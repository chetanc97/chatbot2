How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Hi.
You know Chastity?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Great
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
Who is she?
Why not?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
You got him involved?
Will Bogey get bent?
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
You and Verona?
Who's that?
What's this?
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
You think this'll work?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
What's this?
Were you in jail?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Who?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
You up for it?
Is that a request or a command?
It's just something I had.  You know
Wait I...
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Which parts?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Macbeth, right?
Say it
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Did I have anything to say about it?
He's the devil's child...
We should have seen land.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
You can see for yourself.
They took everything...
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Chief knows.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
How long?
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
New worlds create new people.
May I speak freely?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
What do you read?
You must be mad...!
You bloody...
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Your mother was blind?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
What are you asking me?
Are you alright?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Oh.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
What was that, Korfin?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
I'm gonna propose.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Who's there?
What's wrong?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Nah, I musta missed it.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
You goin' to the escort service?
I'll let you know what happens.
Two heads.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
I'm serious here.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Is it drug related?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Thank you.
How old are your kids?
Okay.  You ready?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Hi, I'm Honey.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
We are both from Prague.
This all you want?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Speak English!
Whore?
Why not?
Let me get a shot of it.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
We started over, you can too.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
Well, he...
Yes...he's my friend.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
You okay?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Two more.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONTINUED
CONINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Are you coming to my party?
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Really?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
I see.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Name?
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I want to drive awhile.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
How about it?
I hear you've got visitors.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Yeah, I noticed...
You're crazy.
Bullshit.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Hey, this works pretty good.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Hey, you wanna bet?
You made that move, huh?
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
We split 50-50?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
We missed.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Do I get to kiss her too?
Yeah...
What a screw-up.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
That's what you say, Cates...
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Who are all these?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Bullshit red tape.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
How do you know?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Who the hell are you?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
How ya doin'?
When?
Rosalie, you okay?
You want to go outside?
How much?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
He's a she!
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
Do you love her?
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Eto Akta Gamat!
...What's your name?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
You have nine points left on your license..
6... 5...
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
You know how to fly this thing?
Dinoine chagantakat!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Which one?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Here we go again...
You noticed..
It's up to you now, Angel!
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Tell me...
It's not?
Talk English Doc.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
Is that better?
Wait or act.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Am I disturbing you?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Welcome home.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Okay, I believe you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Hello?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You should have.
Who are you calling?
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are these?
Bullshit.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
I want to watch you work.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
I'm gonna kill you.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
How much did he pay you?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
I never killed anyone.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
You are a private investigator?
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
You're asking me why?
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
How old are you?
Where are your parents?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Alright, I get the picture.
Who is he?
Who is he, his name?
What's next?
He succeeded.
You... you need to go to the police.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Do you think the police did a good job?
Yes... I remember Mary
Do you know what happened to her?
Her belongings?
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
I'm sure they're around.
You what?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Then you saw him, too?
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
You just feel sorry for me.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Is that who you're waiting for?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
What do you mean?
About him?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
There you go.  Love you.
Where are we going?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
Mark, are you okay?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Vomit?
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
You, too?
How is he - ?
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
We're stuck tight!
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
As we near the Pole...
All ready?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
Why?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Always has been.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You don't believe me?
What are you boys up to?
Chub says you're fired.
Oh.
He's on to us!
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Bastard's got his high beams on.
You stayed away?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
I'm fucking out of here.
Why do they do that?
You know.
Yeah. It's stupid.
I just think you used to be bad.
What then?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
How about a Big Mac?
What do you want, then?
You don't want the extra police pay?
What's the hurry?
Huh?
You? Why?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
The key, Wade.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
It's just...
See. Get your boots.
Good. Who?
I still don't understand --
How's she doing?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
You've been married twice --
I know your parents.
This is nuts.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Who are you?
Something about my father?
It don't look right.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
The other guy.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Yeah.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What about Margie?
I don't know. You tell me.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
There they are!
Put your pilot on.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Why?
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Who did this?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
*                     Please tell me your name.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
You know what?
How did your speech go?
The fax machines.
and if that means negotiating...
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
Where's my family?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
IT'S OPEN!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
What's the story?
Shut down accelerators.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Elaine.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Now!
Ted, the lever!
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
He's a boy dog.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Surely you can't be serious.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Good-bye, darling.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
Oh, I'd love to.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Do you feel all right, sir?
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Nothing?
Get the picture?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Who said that?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
I'm going home.
Where'd you get this?!!
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
We?  You've taken it?
Uh, George...
Shit!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
This floor's freezing.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
You did okay, Bishop.
Is she...?
Amy.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Now, wait a second --
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
One of us?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
How do you feel?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Seventeen meters.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Fifteen meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
So what do I tell this guy?
Don't go!  Please.
Are we going to sleep now?
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Maestro.
Is there a part for me?
Where?
What's that?
What did you think of the music?
And how will you make him keep it?
Why not?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Tish-I'm-tee.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
What's the matter with you?
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
You're not going to do this?
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Why not?
Really?
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Originals?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Why you?
Where's our friend?
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Be careful!
Behold!
Upstairs.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Why not?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Would you tell me why?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Why not?
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Papa, is this your idea?
Father -
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Not that I've seen.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Opera? Opera!
What?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
What?
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
How could I not?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
Did my work please you?
A Mass for the dead.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
How long will you give me?
No, please.
Shall I answer it?
And that's all?
And that's it. Do you have it?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Is the Emperor angry with me?
No, but I'm the best.
Herr Mozart -
Mozart -
About what?
What do you want?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
What?
Yes.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
What anger?
Here I am, my angel.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Well, promise then.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Can we come in?
I'll call tomorrow.
How did he look?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Call me David.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Do you like it?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Now what do you want to talk about?
That's easy enough.
Are you better now?
My friend Jack was just here.
The bedroom.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Anything.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Hello, Benjamin.
No what?
I think he's a Jew.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Jack.
You're not having a good time are you?
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Okay.
Ask them what the candles are for.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Did you hear that?
A coyote.
Shit! David, what is that?
Come on, where?
It's moving.
What's the plan?
Oh shit. What is that?
See anything?
Nice to see you.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Jack, are you really dead?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Because this must be stopped.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Sorry, love.
What's that?
Then you have some hot tea?
Remember the Alamo?
No, thank you.
Sorry.
Hello, Tom.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Whose death?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
What do you mean?
know, but—
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Much better this morning, thank you.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes, of course.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Yes?
Helen!
It's all right. Thanks.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
I already told him I was home.
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
No.
Yes.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
He was in the bank yesterday.
—for the rheumatism, you know.
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
What time did you get in?
Everybody in?
Where's Charlie?
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
Bob. I didn't...
I'm sorry, Cole.
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
What?
Where you boys going?
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
What are you saying?
Still smells fishy.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
We'll make them pay for this.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Where'd you get all these riders?
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
What the --
Another dozen out back.
The safe. Now.
What?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
What the --
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
You know you're welcome any time!
Daddy, don't start with this again.
Distracting enough for you?
"Big and older"?
You are a charmer.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
How'd it go in there?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
We're doing this for Ma.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
How much of that story is true?
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Let the law --
I don't understand.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Let me see that.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Was it worth it?
You cocky little bastard.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
Well, not exactly.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
That.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes?
Uh huh.
Dorsia's nice.
Pick me up?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
J&B. Straight.
Are we here?
Luis is a despicable twit.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
I haven't seen you around here.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Nothing like last time, promise.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
We should do it.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
He has a great body
Why? What's wrong?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Listen, what about dinner?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
It looks so soft.
Call me please, Patrick.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Dorsia, yes?
After six.
Oh, something. . romantic?
What is it?
Anywhere you want?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Do you have a boyfriend?
Interesting.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Jean? What?
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
...to the office this afternoon.
Just...say...no!
Welt...it depends, why?
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Nice. Very nice.
Would you rather I not smoke?
He had a yacht?
So was I.
Have you consulted a psychic?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
That's so typical, isn't it?
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
Well, I could he wrong.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
I've questioned him.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Is that a raincoat?
You don't wanna move, do you?
...But?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Great!
...What?
Milo?
...wanna savor this.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
What?
Is it your software?
Milo? I'm Danny.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
'Think I should buy some originals?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
It's okay. Really.
Did you?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Gary, hi.
I'm okay. It's going well!
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
What?
I think you should go.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Every entry was authorized.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Did you wanna be alone?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
...Milo?
Do we post it on the Net?
Time?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Why were you snooping in my office?
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Thank God.
Maybe it's the satellite.
Latitude 47 degrees.
Is that how Larry feels?
So -- how far are we from the campus?
What're they building?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
What is it?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Yes?
Carnies.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Be careful.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
That does not compute.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
I can't see a bloody thing.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Why?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
I can't. You're drunk.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Austin, I'm coming with you.
Kiss me.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Ow! You shot me!
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Quite impressive.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Umm, that also has already happened.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
You didn't...
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
Knight ...
Flower ...
Nature ...
Hope...
Fear ...
You
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
You are female?
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Quite a collection.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Such as?
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
What on earth?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
But
This must be the last straw.
You followed me.
Yes ... ?
But you did suspect me.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Trubshaw again? What now?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Makes two of us.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Insane ... ?
This man -- did you see him?
I was hoping you could tell me.
You with Mother or Father?
John Steed.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I've decided not to run for President.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I love that car.
Fine. How's everything going?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
No, Cole, I...
What are we having?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
That feels so great.
I can't trust you!
I don't believe you.
Why is Cole here?
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Really?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Are any of those right?
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Mr. Thomerson, I...
The end.
Ed... you're kinky!
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Oh these moments do try me...
Wash it to the windows?
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Biggest in two battalions.
-- Knock it off!
Is he...
It doesn't go like that.
Been ripping off fire stations?
Thanks.
Roll the hose.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I saw it.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
-- What were they doing there?
Anything else?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
You're back.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Arson.
Hey.
I could use a date.
Hi.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Brian. What's wrong?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
I want another shot, Sir.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
-- Shhh.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
Nice bunch of guys.
Your brother was a good man.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Yeah. Big fan.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Completely out of control.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
He just wants to --
Where's Sean?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
I treated you better.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Knock it off. Now.
-- Burn them.
Got a cause?
I'm working on it.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I'm a little busy right now --
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
People.
Yeah.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Large?
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Oh, really?
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Keep trying.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Seconds and thirds, too.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Good morning, Cheeba.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
Nice to meet you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
That's a great handle.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Yep, you guessed it.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
What do you want?
That's what I'm askin'.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
How was it?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
You okay?
Just want to say good luck.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
So you have your small victory, now what?
For what?
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
How so?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Yes, your name?
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Can I kiss you too?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
Peerless, your father called.
Yes he did.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
You sing and dance?
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
No, not that.  How 'bout...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
Oh you do, huh?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
You don't read, do you?
And?
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
I know I won't be your puppet.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
What is the service, sir?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Then you yield to me.
Not even that.
Not one.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Was he cheated?
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
I beg your pardon?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He is only curious to know who you are.
He loves me, as I love you.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
You framed-him...
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
You too?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
You smoke, Ray?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
He -- He made me do it --
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Cadet, what's your name!
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Something funny, Levi?
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
Dunbar.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Are you sure?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
That's a fantastic idea --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Four --
Hardy, what are you doing --
This isn't the time --
Do I have a choice in this?
Maybe we shouldn't go.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
He said what?
But you didn't see it, right?
Pike never confessed.
It won't work --
What happened with Nunez?
What the fuck happened to you --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
I used it to start the fire --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
You think he did it?
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Great, great. That's fantastic.
What is this place?
I have to leave. Tonight.
Or are you too scared?
How long have you known my father?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Promise me you'll come back.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
Really.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
There was one time when I was eleven...
Karl.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
You're not trying to run away?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
She was a witch.
When did you ever work in an office?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Son?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Tell me how it happens.
I'm sorry.
So what are you up to now?
What happened?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Is he awake?
Mom?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
Yeah it was okay.
The sets were good.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
What? What are you doing?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Right.
So?
You must have a visa or something...
Binoculars.
What was that?
How is bank?
I understand. I'm so sorry
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
I don't understand.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
I don't want to know.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
What?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
And? What are you saying?
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I got what I paid for.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You don't understand me.
You are throwing me out.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Are you scared?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
Nobody's that unhappy.
You know you can come under the blanket.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Yeah. No thanks.
It's not mine.
What does it mean?
My name's Sophia.
You have excellent English.
How do you want to pay?
What are you doing?
I need to uh...
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
When? Now? Oh. No.
Still need a lift?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Don't... don't say that to me...
Where's Ronnie?
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
What is it?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
You need some weed?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
Goin' dove huntin'?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
The hell is this shit?
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
I skipped lunch.
You a preacher?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
What happened to your face?
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
I think she got to you, pappy.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Back-up.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What are they doing now?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
You cool, Ich?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Short shift?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Nick...
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
You can't come in.  They don't want --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
It's very small.
It's illegal, Nick.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
Joyce?
Someone attacked him.
Thank you.  You have one?
I'm sorry.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
They want your autograph.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
We're in?
Dope?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
What's this?
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
You trust me?
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
One man.  He must be good.
I've done some questionable things.
Why are you staring at us?
We have a lot in common.
You could help us.
I didn't like her.
You start.
Okay, but...
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Next.
Prosit.
I like you.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Let's hear it.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
What if you change your mind?
Why didn't you go?
Taffey Lewis?
Who?
The best.
Jeezus!
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Do I make you nervous?
I told you I'd come back.
Do you dream?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Uh-huh.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Bad?
How many questions did it take?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Know what a turtle is?
What's your name?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Get out of here!
Where are we going?
No, I'm lost.
Dickhead?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Over this?
Hey, what are you doing?!
See, ya.
...Okay.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Very funny, smart ass.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Yes.
I don't want to be alone.
Now, get out!!
Stop that ma'am crap!
You almost got us killed!
He has a computer?
All right.
I certainly do!
No it's not!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
I like her.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
There.
Really?  Okay!
Hi, Eve!
I've got to go, now.
Oh, boy! A jacket!
...the pipe tobacco.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Not on him.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
What?!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
You dial nine to get out.
What?  What is it?!
The sky?  Where?
Whatcha looking at?
I do alright.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Dad!
I'm afraid you've got to.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
This is your bedroom?
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
You got a light, honey?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
It shuts off automatically.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Days??
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Yes!
Get the presents and do the lights.
Yes.
We stay down here.
Yes.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Alright, I will.
Just be yourself.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
To bed?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
I don't think so.
What do you want to do with it?
We came back to the house!
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
What is this? What color is it?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Yes.
No. What is happening?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who is Don?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Yes. Frank--
Do you like my body?
I want you to hurt me.
I asked first.
I'm glad you do.
Yes.
I'll call you.
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Frank gone?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
MOMMY!
Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Can I feel 'em?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hello?
Hey? You like to walk.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
What?
Nothing. I'm fine.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Well.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
How ya doin' Dad?
How is Central these days?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I've gotta go in.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Are you alright?
So, what's next?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
What's the plan.
Yeah, but.
Okay, yeah, call.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
You like mysteries that much?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Yes sir.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Anybody you think is evil?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
What?
Anybody see ya?
What? What is it?
They got nothing.
You guys?
What?! What are you doin'?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Would someone please come over here and...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
That was way easier than I thought.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Give the guy a shot.
We do not want your tired and sick.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
She was in here when it went down.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
What?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
The what man?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Oh my god!
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Roc. You okay?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hello? You there?
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Forgive me father.
Have you no fear of God?
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Making Hutch David Soul?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
This is he?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
I'm lookout.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Where's the manager?
There's another stocker, right?
Yeah.
What's wrong with him?
Why not?
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Which one was that?
She's from Cuba.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was I?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
She doesn't need to know.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Who's in the car?
What time did he say to be here?
Dignan. Take it easy.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
You're all clear.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Freeze!
Who tripped the alarm?
What are you doing?
Wait for Kumar.
What?
Like amnesia.
What'd he get?
Why?
No. I'm not.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Did you ever steal a car before?
Hector woudn't do anything.
Could you grow cinnamon?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Anthony, I --
Why not?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Let's not even talk about it.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Yeah.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
That's Anthony.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Are you a fag?
No.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
What was that all about?
What did I say?
Where'd she go?
What are you doing?
You really think he'll remember you?
You can go first, Bob.
That could be anybody's.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
What do you mean get back?
Not in that car you're not.
Dignan.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Scarecrow?
Everything OK?
I couldn't hear anything.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Applejack drove.
Do you have your own room?
Hold on --
Wait a second --
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
The grammar?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Where did he go?
Is that your chiquita?
No. Just pool.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
And what are we looking for?
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Show me again...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
Because you're afraid!
So why didn't you kill me then?
Try again.
Pamela Landy?
What's going on in Berlin?
-- what? --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I love you, too.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
And you got to him before we could.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
That's a lie!
No... Jason... please...
Who?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
We need to get in there.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
You're sure?
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Amnesia?
Some women like Dobermans --
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
But... what will you do?
Young Robert, we are honored --
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
No, M'lord.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
The little cow is insane --
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
When will his trial be?
I'll wait... back there.
I don't want to be a martyr.
That's just a dream, William!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Three, maybe more!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Where is my son?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Thank you for accepting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Then when?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Anything.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
No dances, just tell me.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
What does that mean for Evan?
Just. Like. Jason.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Dad lives here?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
Why are you doing all this for me?
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
Where are we going?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
So what's the point?
Smells like sex in here.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Come on, go on...
It didn't feel like a dream.
Are you sure you even packed it?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Look what you made me do!
Just get out, didja?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Meant no offense.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
He did. Captain Renault did.
How long have you been married?
Yes, I'll bet.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Good.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Yes, I come.
Er, goodbye, sir.
What do you want for Sam?
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
Do you know where they are?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
A franc for your thoughts.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
Please.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Good morning.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
This is hardly the time or the place.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
It was a combination of all three.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Is that a serious offer?
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Sam's piano.
I have. Sit down over there.
Will I see you tonight?
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Hello?
Get me the Radio Tower!
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Rick! Rick, help me!
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
No. Not me, boss.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
What are you doing?
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
What brings you out to the sticks?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Four four.  A record.
I can't even keep fish alive.
You know, for when you travel.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
No.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
What was inside?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
This is so unfair.
You okay?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
Need some help?
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
Really?
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Hello?
Hello.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
Digital laser readers.
That's what it's about.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Only if you can afford it.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
These *credentials* are against the law!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What's she so emotional about?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
Where's Mandalay?
Oh...
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
I better go.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Do you think she'll be all right?
How is that Wally doing?
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
But did you know him?
What's a nanny do?
What's an immigrant?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
I'm stayin', Homer.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
Do you like to read?
I'm not in trouble.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Do you know him?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
*What* view?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
I told him that you all is sick.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
We had to finalize the deal.
This has to happen fast.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Grifters...
So how'd you get caught?
But there were other factors.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
She had you tempting fate.
We were back on.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Jake...
I'm going home
Moonan. Here. Shit...
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
You'll be there?
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Excuse me?
Come on. Harder.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
No.  What's my cut?
What do I have to do?
What about Customs?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Mr. King, I think --
Uh... Everything okay?
I gotta go get a haircut.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Do you have something to prove?
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
Yeah.
Is it all fugasi?
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
King ain't gonna like this.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Stand up.
What happened?
Pretty much.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
So what do you want?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
I'll take you up on that.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
The Indian rope-trick.
How about fifteen hundred?
She went back to South Africa.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I found her in bed with someone.
And your lady?
You really are a beautiful woman.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
It came my way. 450 a week.
Are you trying to read my palm?
You're shaking. What is it?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Nothing about you.
Here...use a spoon.
Great.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
I've lived there.
To coincidence.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
Near the casino.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
I didn't.
I'm in trouble.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Yes.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
And your hand too.
Detective Inspector Ross.
Ross.
Where to?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Who are these guys?
And the girls?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
How many aces are left?
I make it six.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
I just want the job.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Thanks for the information.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
Yeah.
Fuck that shit.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
That's it.
Why don't you have more time?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Pinback...
In a second.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Veil nebula.
You know what I think about, Talby?
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Sir?
Who are you?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
What?
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Can I say something in my defense?
Do you know why I went after Justine?
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
I know.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Soon, baby.
How'd you find me?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Girlfriend?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
Well, not me personally.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I think you should go now.
Say the words, "I understand."
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Gotta go.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Please...
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Catch you back at the wall.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Pick a song, Hawk.
We've got to take this slow...
Namely?
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Whoa... she just farted.
Sunday, but...
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Uh... dudes?
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Cool.
They're not idiots.
Mom, what're we...?
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Look, you can have my wallet...
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Hi... what's going on here?
Dr. Monnitoff?
Theoretically.
Beg pardon?
I'm not following you.
When can I squeeze one out?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Why did you make me flood the school?
Where did you come from?
Why do they call you Frank?
How much longer is this gonna last?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
You're weird.
Where are we going?
Where are you going?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
That's alright... I understand.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
People aren't that simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Know what?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Grandma Death.
Who is Frank?
Cellar door.
I think he saved my life.
Don't you watch the news?
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
Follow him where?
What else do you think about during school?
What about your family, Donnie?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
I think now that he might...
How is that possible?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
If that's what you think is necessary.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
He was a year ahead of us?
Christ. Is that an axe?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
Where is she?!
You're what?!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
What is wrong with you?
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Go on! Get out!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
What're you doin' here?
And the bite marks on my ears?
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
I'm a mirror.
That bitch from...
Wisconsin.
And the year before that?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
What!
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Here I am, Father.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
Here I am, Father...
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Have you got a license?
What kind of a dog is he?
Well - what is he now?
Half watch dog?
Oh no, I can't do it.
What other job you got?
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
You no gotta no gun.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Anything else? 
Excellency, may I present my niece.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
So that's the one you want to marry.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
One or two?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
What do you mean?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
You stay with me.
More romances for John?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
I found it.
What are you going to do?
What happened?
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
How are you feeling today?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Good day...!
Oh, no.
She's very pretty, your mother.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Tell me about it, please!
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Is he... dying then?
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
...Yyes
Hello...
John... Merrick
Mmmerrick.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
Who are they of?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Yes John?
No, John, not one that I can see.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Well...
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Pardon me?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
WELCOME?
Please! Please! What are those?
What's the matter?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
But you LOVED her all the same...
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
Do you believe I love you?
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But --
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Would you like us to sing to you?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
What about the raping?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
You told them I raped you -- why?
Why?
Is THAT Odin?
"But" what?
How deep IS the ocean?
You talking piffle, son?
Who have you been talking to?
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
SHUT UP!
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
Weren't we supposed to?
Wait, Erik!
What do you think?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
I AM one, Dad!
She hasn't got any.
Sven!
Bye, Leif.
It can't do you any HARM...
You know, my son, our lord said...
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Help!
Shut up!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
So did my father and his father before him.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Shut up.
And you've got BOTH axes?
And something to sharpen them with?
Yeah, you told me that later.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
And I just liked you so much.
Come over after I'm done here?
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I don't have one.
I like it.
I'm sure you would.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Um --
You like that?
What do you want to hear?
You just say. I'm not really --
Thanks.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
You should stay.
You're drunk.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
What if you hide me?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Happy Birthday.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah.
Right. Something black though.
I'm sure, I said.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Oh God, how horrid.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
I think, before.
I wish we did. You married?
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Male or female?
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
It's dark.
So go.
What if you stay this time?
So you'll call me, right?
I don't know. What if it breaks?
A bully? Moi?
Doesn't sound like me.
It's true.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
That's me.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
How's the chicken?
Okay. I wish you could come.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Yours?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
It's stopped.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
He's coming?
I swear.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
And after that?
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
Oh.
Howard, your one o'clock.
What, Howard?
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
You made me have an abortion.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Mary. What are you doing here?
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
Tell me about it.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
I'm cold.
What are you doing?
Thanks.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
But Countess...
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
We have a man down...
Coffee.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
What's happening?
How? The Bridge is gone.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
What...?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
What is it?
90 over 50 and falling... .
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
Explanation?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
You can't leave. She won't let you.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Heading three-three-four...
It is now.  We're locked in.
But...
Captain Miller, you copy?
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
That's an affirmative.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
Miller...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Weir can't be alive.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Almost got it.
We have to do something, oh God...
What?
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
You can't do that.
A straight line.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
What is it?
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
You look like an eighties rock band.
What do you want, Vic?
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Isn't that your speech?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
We're working as hard as we can --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Hey! That's a prototype!
No more cracks about how I look.
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Stop it.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
You two need a time-out.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
That's good. That's uh... good.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
How much did they cost?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Hi, Brad.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Do you have any ice tea?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Did you get her name?
Did you go home and get it?
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Who's that?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Was it great?
You'll always remember your first time.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
I paid for it and everything.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Sometime?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
Is this your first time?
I had a really nice time tonight.
I don't know.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
What's April 16th?
Hi, Mark.
Really?
Anything to drink?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
...and we're chock full of that!
Where's the medicine?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
I want to leave fast.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
I want that fucking radio!
The cops?
WELL? What are your plans?
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
NO! Stop talking like that.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
No, she's looking for you.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
The airport is over there!
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
What?
Careful.
I will not die because of him!
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
We'll meet in three hours?
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I think I know where a CB is.
So, your husband ditched you?
They're right here.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
What now, Geronimo?
Why do you take shit from him?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
How are you holding up?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
What do you mean what?
What's going on between you two?
Is it gassed up?
Four door?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I wouldn't do that, son.
I'll go with ya.
Bullshit.
Fine, Chief.
OH JESUS!
Hey!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Let's move.
What's wrong?
Let's wait it out.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Oh my God... What is that?
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Are you lying to me?
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
You're afraid!
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
Where's Clifford?
You don't think I'm good enough?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
Thank you, Ralph.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Bread?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Harry.
Well? What'd you think?
How'd I look?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
You don't know what you want.
Frances...
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
The chauffeur. He's watching.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Take a walk, pal.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
What a man!
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Frances, You're crazy.
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
That would be okay.
And no people.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
I live here.
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
You think I got it?
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It's okay.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
I think I need a little air.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
No!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
Yes...?
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Normal. Average.
Is there something else?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
What can I do?
Soon?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Must've been a terrible row.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Are you all right?
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
This feels... incestuous.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
I thought I'd never see you again!
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
I was just clearing my throat.
You can't. Death is God's will!
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Quite a place.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Philosophical?
Re-configure the leads?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Ah. An explorer.
We should go now.
Melvin Belli.
Cabin B is ready.
How come you're leaving?
It sounded like Brenda.
Jack?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
What the hell?
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
What hath God wrought?
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Don't call him.
Mmmmmmmph?
Cowboy.
How much do I owe you?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Where is the little lady?
She's dead?
Died instantly?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Is this real?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
What are you going to do?
What's this stuff?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
What?
Do you believe me?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
See ya.
-- you got your sink --
-- see this, television!
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Hot goddamn day!
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I never said help us!
Best in Mexico.
Start the car.
Do they have cable?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
What'd ya see?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Keep your voice down.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
The woman I saw you with...
Got it.
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
No, sir, WHAT?
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Shit.  Think we're had.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Uh, ma'am.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
O'Neil?
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
So why are you telling me this?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
"In Washington..."
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
At first.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Got it.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Clear.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Where's Audrey?
I like that image.
That why you dumped him?
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
So you made it.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Are you okay?
Who was that French guy, anyway.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Your old sweetheart?
Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
I can't.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Hence the radiation.
I'm sorry about all this.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
They didn't make it.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
Are you looking for this?
I need you to trust me.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Don't speak, Quellek.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
Go ahead!
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
And note the sucked in gut.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
What's the weather like outside?
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
Covalent... Right. So...
As good as Hopkins?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
...Okay
More to the left... Stay parallel...
They're gone.
~e're alive!
What?
But I'm the Commander!
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
There's nobody here. Jason...
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
You know, that's really getting annoying.
I heard it too.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
But what if Sarris survives?
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Mathesar? What is that?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
"Deception..." "Lies."
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Where?
Anything.
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Over three hundred miles.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Arnold!
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
Wil...
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
Well, what have you thought?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
How old are you, Captain?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
What are we going to do?
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Partially...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
General Lee is detained captain...
The British army, sir!
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
A grand scheme?
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
And how rusty are these muskets?
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
What is it, Marquis?
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
I feel the same, sir.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
To win this war I need an army.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Not today.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
But, you do come from a military family?
A horseshoer?
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
George, you know I only love you, but...
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
Then why are you teaching me...?
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
What are you doing?
What is this?
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
I guess still in the locker.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Who?
You get the money?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
About sixty.
Where is my nephew?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
You gave him the money?
He's around someplace.
She's... young.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
You know how to write one of these?
I need the money.
You positive about that?
I'm working on a few things.
C-18.
Ray Barboni?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Why would I do that?
Get in line, bro.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I want you to.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
That's it? That's your movie?
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
Ever shot anybody.
For a movie?
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Just a thought.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
What?
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Yeah, he told me.
We talk different?
So you want to know.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
You been here the whole time?
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Yeah?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Harry... My God...
You sure?
I don't know.
You okay?
You don't act like it?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
I told you not to -–
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Whatta you doing out there?
Yeah, but whose point of view?
I miss Murray, Harry.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
What's wrong?
I don't have a dog.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
How about now?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
What's so great about Sweden?
Let's not be too hasty.
What day is it?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Ready?
Maybe that is his boat.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Smokes?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Get up.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
Mother fucker!
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long?
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
Dodge to Murphy.
I think you know.
The radio!
What the fuck -- ?
What the hell happened!
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Could be a fishing boat.
Candy?
She was sailing up north, right?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Are you sure?
How's he doing?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Hey.
What happened.
Nope.
What do we do with him?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Call the Coastguard?
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
How're you feeling?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Say what?
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
Can't find the shotgun.
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
No, no. You got leak.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Guess.
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
What?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
What the hell is wrong with you?!
It's not optional!
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Yeah, right.
No.
Hi... what's up?
Yeah, well --
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Since when is she an "actress"?
Hi.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Did you sign up yet?
Does Oomie really like this show?
So what should we do?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
You call.
What's he doing now?
He's insane!
This is way too creepy.
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Not really...
"Funky"?
Just promise you'll do it.
We still have to go in there sometime.
I'll bet he never jerks off...
How about this one?
Ew ... when did you get that?
It's a surprise.
I totally, totally hate you.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Look, we have to get these...
Don't you want nice stuff?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Why? What did he say?
So, whaddya think?
There.
Wow... finally.
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Didn't they tell you?
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
I - I'd really rather not...
I don't think so...
Relax, Seymour, relax...
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
For nineteen years...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Hey, can I borrow this?
You can open your eyes now.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Never...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Oh, hi...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
...What do you mean?
What are you doing here?
What's up?
What's the matter?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
What do you want?
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Why would she be hiding from me?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
What are you talking about?
Seymour?
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
Starting now, we attack them.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
I do need to see Starling.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
And it worked?
What?
Understand, I had help-
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
We need to talk.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Good luck.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
I am also liaison between these two.
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Janosz?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
What do you want with my baby?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Then why have you come?
I command you.
You've got to do something!
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
You were supposed to help me with this.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
This is what you do with your spare time?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Are you all right?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
She's moving!
Tell him about the toaster.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
You really don't act like a scientist.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
He is the Destructor.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
That is one speedy mutt.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Yes?
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Did you see anything?
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Where's the Keymaster?
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
For what purpose?
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
How do you know?
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Those are priceless sculptures.
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
What is that... wailing?
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
I want that bastard dead!
I am their hero!
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Caesar, ignore them.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Take grain away from the army?
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
You cannot die.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
The Senators admire you.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
What about their philosophy lessons?
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
Narcissus!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
How much money is involved?
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Why not?
Will you take me home now?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Benjamin --
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
With a family?
Yes.
What's the matter?
No -- don't cry --
Don't cry. 
But you're not enrolled.
Is it because I'm here?
Why?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Don't tell me --
What are you going to do now?
Are you going home?
But you might.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
You really will?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
The day after tomorrow?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Ben.
You're not one of those agitators?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
What for?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
I'd rather not.
Did you get a room?
Give me an hour.
A single room or a double room?
Where is it?
Where is your luggage?
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Drink?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
What are you so scared of?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Benjamin?
May I sit down?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want me to get it?
Why don't you get it.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
What?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Thank you.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you want to hear it or not?
How do you get out of the house?
What do you say to him?
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
What was your major?
Do you remember the make of the car?
No.
I have my reasons.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Well, I'm not.
What?
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Nothing else.
Why did you say that?
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
I'm just --
I guess -- about my future.
Have you thought about graduate school?
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
I know.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Hello.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Is anything wrong?
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
Have you a minute now?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
No -- no -- no -- no...
I don't like your tone.
I've quit.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Chasing around.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I want to be alone --
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
There.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Do you understand?
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Why?
Till then.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
What?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
It's always so quiet here.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
For me?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
I don't know.
Telegrams?
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
Oh, I've got to find it.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
No - absinthe.
You like music?
You dance splendidly.
What's the matter?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Moreover...
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
What is this?
What?
No.
Can you pay some attention to me?
Baron!
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
What?
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
I mean with the Manchester people?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I know you did -- I said you did --
Sorry, Preysing. 
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
What?
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
How clear is Manchester?
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
I can't dance tonight --
Let us cancel the engagement.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam should sleep.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Good morning, Pimenov.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Four minutes past. Please come.
I know -- I know.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Next week.
What's bluff?
What you need is some relaxation.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Hi, Bobo.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
You know it, Lilly.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Here you are! Two rich people!
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Kaggs. Home office.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
So what's your story today?
They knocked out my tooth!
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
I like those.
Not as tough as you, huh?
Lucky? You call that lucky?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
No.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
Well, uh...
Where's the five?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Look at me.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
What?
Is that right?
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
You -- I don't know.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
Roy Dillon?
That's natural.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
What?
Mr. Simms.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Mind if we sit down?
Carter.
My god...
Do you know who did this?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
Where are you going?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
I'm not leaving without her.
What?  Where is she?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Not me.
What are you doing here?!
Then I'll get caught.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
This kid just wants his freedom.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Let the party begin.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Whatever happened to women in back?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Aren't you gonna answer that?
You've been watching too much TV.
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
Where's the baby?!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Where's the child?
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
You've created a monster.
What do you know about Michael?
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Hm?
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
At least we found the diamonds.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
I'm liable to find anything!
You ever own a motorcycle?
And how were things?
Could have happened to anybody.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
I didn't know we had any women left.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Okay.  Okay.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
Blue soup.
Fifty years?
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Hello.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
Man and boy.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
What's this?
That's a rifle you have?
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Can I help you, sir?
What do you do for a living?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Bluh.
What's that all about?
Your old beau?
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Now that's what I call fun.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
Which one?
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
That's what you're supposed to say.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
I came for Paul as well.
A dozen?
He knows you shattered his violin.
He cried.
Two hundred years old.
No you don't.
Honor, I suppose.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
No.
I mean it!
Help your mother find the bullet.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
You've been bitten by bats?
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
This is man to man.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
Cut me open.  Find out.
The new hero is you.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
For what?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
What's this?
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
Don't touch me.
No.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
That's an interesting piece of news.
Then who flushed the toilet?
What's his name?
Mom?
That's why I'm crying.
Really?
It's fine!
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
Please--
He'd assume we had.
Did you see him?
The park!
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What's the matter now?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
It's true.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
What kind of a life is that?
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Get out of here.
You've got to fight from time to time.
Or get eaten alive.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
No, just not the type.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're still dressed?
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
No, I don't.
What?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
Hello. You want some information?
We offer...
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
It's your money. You talk.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where is she?
Up front?
Jesus.
Say what?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
What's T-J?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
You are.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
In G.R.? Why?
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
They're legal now.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Where'd you hear that name?
What happened, pilgrim?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
Wes, do me a favor.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
What you got in mind?
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
It's a short film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Not exactly...
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
Hold it, mister.
I don't know.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Huh?
To his own daughter?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
And what are you studying?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
How long have you been driving?
Took it?
Lady, let me get this straight.
But there is a family resemblance.
No.
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
What do you see?
I don't know.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Me! No. Of course not.
No. 
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Okay?
I think he's following us.
He's stopped.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
You are the wisest person I know.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
Do you think there is any life up there?
- end where I began.
Farewell?
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
This is insane.
How do you do?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Just give me a rough estimate.
And a lot of time.
No.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
What would you say?
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
It's different for us.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
It's a beautiful dress...
The box. I need the box.
What?
What do you mean?
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Wait!
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
I... remember.
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
The freak in the gas mask --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
It's almost over!!
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Son. About Rasputin --
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
What are you trying to say?
Each of us gets a belt.
You're kidding --
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
What took you so long?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
What about you?
It's freezing, isn't it?
Hello, I'm --
Yes, I --
Pardon?
It's my lucky day.
What's happening?
Lucky man.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
You bastard --
Frank --
I'm brother Frank.
What about Larry --
No. God no.
What happened to you?
Back from where?
I'm hurting
Later.
A long time.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
Well we can't just stay here --
What happened?
Not exactly modern.
You're still blaming me.
All right.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
I'll be down in a minute
Who was it?
-- I'll go see.
What's wrong?
What are you talking about?
You know it's not often I... you know...
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
First time for everything.
Oh Christ.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
You'd like the house.
Well I want you to see the house.
Great.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Of course. Every day.
Big house.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Are you O.K.?
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
I'm afraid it's true.
Need any help?
Are you busy after work ?
What's wrong?
I'll come back later, huh?
You gotta be kidding me.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
We can take your car.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
My band.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
The little skate-fuckers.
Why not?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
He's got one!
Anna.
Uh.  That's me.
Right.  Why?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Is that it?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
No, that's okay.  Really.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Rob.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
Did you say something?
Yeah.  Great.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Is it better?
Of course it is.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
So, how are you?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
Will you call me?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I guess I am.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
What do you mean?
What do you want to do?
What?
Laura...
What it was like.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
You know the difference.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Hi.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
So?
About what?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
I'll call you.
She left.  She's gone.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
What do you think?
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
You're very macabre.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
It's not mine.
Good reflexes.
Jesus Christ.
What about me?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
He sees me as a threat.
You're using your son's name.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I hope I never get that old.
Yes.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
What is it?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Good way to lose your job.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Who is it?
Your marks would suggest great injury.
How can you know this?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Does it change with me in the room?
I don't understand.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
It is the truth.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
Why does he want to kill me?
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Complete your inspection?
Your name?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
_Answer_ me.
How are you?
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
He found us even there.
I knew his great-grandfather.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Long time.
Friend of yours?
Run!
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
This your present address?
You're a kind man to be sure.
The resemblance is amazing.
Morning Mr. North
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
But --
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Hildy!
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Mr. Burns --
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Mother? But your mother --
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
How long would the interview take?
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Hildy!
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
What's this?
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
What do you want?
How long is what?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Sure you can. Come on.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
You can't sell me that, Walter.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Afraid? I should say not!
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
What now?
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Hildy!
All the words you've got.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Double-crossing swine!
What happened?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Flip a coin.
Then why are you doing it?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
How much?
They're always after me for interviews.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
Well, that about covers everything.
Who locked the door?
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
No -- don't out me off.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Who is this man?
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Any news?
You fight it cut.
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
Where's the money?
Hiding him where?
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Are you all right, now?
For heaven's sake, why not?
Pinkus.
Get out of here!
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Can I try?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
That was a googly!
Give him the you-know-what.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
I know a secret.
You want to join our gang?
Do you know any swear words?
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
You wouldn't.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
You're the biggest fibber.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Wow!
Who pays for them?
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Except the servicemen.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
No Turks.
We don't know anything about it
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
What is it, pet?
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
I agree.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Thank you.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Why? You gonna do something about it?
But if you did.
But suppose for a second you did.
She's pretty cute.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
She looks like she stinks.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Should we stop?
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Come on, get with the facts.
And...
Is that all... think real hard.
How's about you give me those same directions.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Thank you.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
What are you laughing at?
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
How long has it been?
That's the understatement of the year.
What'd ya got there?
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
This is way too fucked up for words.
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
We gotta break it open.
What about the body you found?
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Plates match.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I guess not.
Over.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
You decide. Today is your day.
Shall we close up, then?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Fine.
Please. I look a mess.
I've moved on.
Hunh.
You were wonderful!
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
No.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
He's dead.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
I'll be in touch.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm sorry?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I'm sorry about my parents.
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
What SPF, sweetie?
Come on.
It's perfect!
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
So, how's it going today?
Really?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
How's work?
I think he's ready.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Extra dessert?
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Puff, put the gun down.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Yes.
Boys just passing through?
Comin' in or goin' out?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Could be.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
How much do I owe you?
Hey, mister.
Poker's not your game.
Pool.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
What's that supposed to mean?
Fine.
Hey, Findley's here.
When do I raise the bet?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
Tell her what?
Half.
Maybe. You want to play?
Who's he?
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
You don't need a drink.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
I want you to come back on the road with me.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Oh yeah? Where?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
When?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You quittin' too?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Okay, friend. You're on.
Have a nice trip.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
Why did you do that?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
No, why should I? It's yours.
You going out?
What are you writing?
Who is it?
He knows. A lot.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Well, what's so funny?
Oh, grow up.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Hundred dollars?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
That's what the game's all about.
Very good shot.
What choice did I have -- ?!
I don't know.
That's who you are too, Emma.
You want me to stay?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Hell of a night.
Is the hill ours too?
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
No.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
No one comes here after dark.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
When?
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
You still believe in him.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
There's good news and bad news.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
Not really...
A countdown to what?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
You try Martin?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Dad, please...
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
What're you doing?
We're loose!
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
And our forces?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
This is ridiculous.
With their shields down it might be possible.
How do you know?
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Really? You don't mind?
Dick-weed!
You scared the hell out of me.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
But I gave you some this morning.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
I'm not leaving.
What the hell's going on?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Call them back.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
What do you want us to do?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Yes.
All my life!
Your treat.
Dad?
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Yes. Now we know.
What about you?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Henry, the pen --
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Schneider?
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
It would make me very happy.
Bingo.
The Ark of the Covenant.
Don't wander off.
It is you Junior!
Found it.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
How did you she was a Nazi?
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
What am I looking for?
The floor's on fire! See?!
And the chair.
Dad!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
It's a new experience for me.
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Uh-huh.
Where's my father?
Why are you trying to kill us?
This is your last chance.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
What?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
You have insulted my son.
What's that?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Come one, what's wrong?
Let up on the brake!
You will go to palace there.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
What'd he say?
Took what?
Indy! Help me!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
What's happening?
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Primitive sexual practices?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I want to go home...
Indy? Did you talk to them?
I can't!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
The last Sankara Stone.
I get it!
Figures...
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Arrrgh!
Who was it?
Who?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Quit screwing around, this is important.
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
I know...it sounds insane.
You're not crazy.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
You'll be alive.
What was that?
Calm Down! Act rational.
Did you hear that?
Yeah...Who is?
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Door's locked.
Just walk down the hall?
Corridor A.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Black suits and helmets.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
They'll know who I am.
The beach?
Holy shit!
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
I don't want to eat it.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
.
Where is she staying?
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Yeah. I did it.
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
I feel like an idiot.
Even Rene?
What is it, your charm?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
You got any books in there?
She's got the most beautiful...s
And on my time.
Some agent you are.
What do I do?
Come on, she's getting away.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
What next!
I can't...
He was with Gruner!
It's him.
What was it? What'd I say?
He hung us up dry.
She is beautiful.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Sorry...
No!
I didn't do anything.
Nice?
I knew you were trouble.
What happened?
Me.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Your memory.
It may have been affected.
When you do...
Right.
Fine. You look fine.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Take the card.
Ahhh...nothing.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Is someone else here?
...Blake
The poet...something he said...
I'll be right there.
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
And you?
You again.
As if your mind's not all there.
Who do you work for?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why did you stay with me?
You work for Ryuji?
You know where he went?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Where what?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Why'd you ask him.
Chiang Cho?
I know the territory.
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
What a mess.
What?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Who are you? Who do you work for?
He can't help us.
He told me what to do.
Come on.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Is there anything else?
It will be fine. You have another.
Could I have it, please.
Yes.
This the only spare?
Ow?...
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Look, nobody knows we did it.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Where?
Mom.
P.J.'s.
When's your deadline?
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
I don't know what he was thinking.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
What are you cooking?
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
You're exaggerating!
What the hell are you doing?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
That computer has everything...
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Right now?
Use the bathroom.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Yeah...
Is it too late?
Oh, my God.
Area code 212-555-0199.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
Yeah.
Thank you for saying that...
Lowell.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Who's that?
...but that's as far as I go...
Did work.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
You believe that?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
Lowell, I can't afford --
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
I told the truth!
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
What about now?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
Poor communication skills.
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object!
You threatening my family, now, too?
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
No!
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Why in God's name would I want...?
You're in check.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Is she Asian?
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
It sounded like a bell.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
I assume this is on Rex?
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
Getting married.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Yes? Marylin?
Screw you, asswipe!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Hmmm...
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No.
But?
I have a surprise for you.
Miles? You're scaring me.
I don't believe you have "things."
I want to nail you ass.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Income tax evasion?
Rex. Get away from the door.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Is this a lover?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
You're not...
But you're going through with it?
Mr. Massey --
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
And she has...?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you think?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
Extinguish?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Three is not Farrow.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What ten thousand?
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
I knocked several times.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Ridiculous!
Peter Warne! 
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Are you going to see him?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Why; naturally, I—
You talk as if—
We've done that already.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
You've got a name, haven't you?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I better go over and see her.
It takes money to buy food.
Yeah.
Not a one.
This looks like the best spot.
What!
Sure.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Eat a carrot.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
That's swell!
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
You're forgetting you're married.
I hope you got your money.
—six—seven—eight—nine—
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
You bet we did.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Oh, by the way—what's your name?
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
What!
You're drunk.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
I'd put you there myself.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Yeah, where am I?
You send telegrams here?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
See that. They're gone!
Huh?
What's up?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Where do you live?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
But why?
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
What's it look like, Nick?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Then who killed the President?
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Daddy!  Where have you been?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Please answer the question.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I know David - a strange character.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Can we find her?
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
It never did. 
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Do you walk home?
What are they?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
You were there for me.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Uh-huh.
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Great, you're here.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
This is your money?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
My pocketbook.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
Help us do what?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
You're not tired of it?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
What did they want to know?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
"American President"
Bring the money in and they follow it?
What about you Max?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
The feds. It's evidence.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Where's the rest of it?
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
That's Ordell's.
Wanna go?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
What if I plead guilty?
Most of the times.
Yes'm.
Oh, Miss Brown?
We'll just be a minute.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
Not really.
What for?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
I'm sure that was the idea.
You said that the last time.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
What did you do after that?
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
It looks good on you.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Beaumont Livingston.
What do you think it is?
What the hell you doin'?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
I understand woman, damn!
Yeah.
The Cockatoo Inn.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
Can you cover that?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Who?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Where at?
What for?
Were you a disco girl?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Wanna fuck?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
As low as two.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
I didn't look like a bum.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
Couldn't talk to her?
You couldn't just hit her?
Came outta where?
What'd you shoot her with?
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
I'm going out for a few hours.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
They don't have your winning personality.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Ten thousand sounds high.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
House or apartment?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
You still there?
How the fuck did he find me?
All I did was walk out with it.
In a way, yes.
She was afraid.
Uh-huh.
It's the next street.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
He ain't here right now.
He's around.
Let me out of here!
Dream on!
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Grass never did that to me.
Daddy. Let go.
You know, you got a strange line here.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Hello.
Daddy, what was that noise?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
A bit.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Who?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
I had this weird flash just then.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
That help?
You up?
Who? Jed?
What?
Is that the one who died?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
We're at Della's.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
How high is that?
What'd the doctor say?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Who else were you expecting?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I want to know. You tell me!
Who was that?
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
I can waitress. I'm good.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
How was Palm Springs?
You got a nice tan, though.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Dream on!
Push 'em back.
We're doing everything we can.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Still married, Jake?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
Can I help you?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Is he all right?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
I don't have all day, kid.
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
It's locked!
His mother?
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Can't shut em' down from here.
Sergeant!
Where the hell were you?!!
Everyone okay?
I'll need system four converters.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Then what do we do?!
You're a teacher.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
What the hell are you doing?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Sergeant!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
You okay?!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
I...I don't know what I did...
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
And what's with the headgear?
Now that's just gross.
This is what it means right here.
Jesus!
What do we do?!!
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
I'm sending you the files.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Guys, please come with me!
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Yes!
Son! -- Out of the water now!
And incidental damages, if any...
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
I never saw one that big.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
That's it! Radio in for help!
Did you get him in the head?
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Right.
Home... New York?
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
Got a pen on you?
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What's that?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
You all right?
Wait a minute! I need you.
Think she might've run out on you?
You here for the summer?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
You wanna call it a night after here?
You love sharks?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
Coming right to us!
He's heading under -- !
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
So, what do you think we should do?
Whose idea was it?
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Really? What are they like?
We could get back together too.
You're being really immature.
Why?
What, you mean as friends?
Mine too.
Can we make out now?
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
We don't even have a dog!
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
What? My eyes are not lying!
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Junk?
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Cute?
You do?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Can I take your coats?
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Yeah, she does.
Only the one in my pants.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
The Penny Saver sucks.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Touche.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Juno, what's the matter?
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Hold still.
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Yeah but, what is it?
...thank you.
...I don't know.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
What's your name, boy?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
This the book your writing?
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
Now why is that?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
Carrie, watch for Early.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
You were plenty hot.
...You know what I mean?
...Janitor's job.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Shit.
Well, how was it?
She can fuck?
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
78th.
Why?
It is right.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Shut up.
Casper! Was up kid?
Where you at?
What?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I'm nervous.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
What is it?
Because your a virgin?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
Dance!
Telly is at Steven's?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
You still mad at him?
Did you bleed?
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Do you know where he went?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yep.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yep.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Slow.
It was... it was.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
We seem to have a little problem here?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
What do you mean, no?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
The door was open.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
The message!  I figured out--
What are you talking about?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
What do you think?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
You still having a problem with this?
How is she?
You alright?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Ready for round two?
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
We'll find the evidence.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
And -- what path is that?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
But you said you didn't know her.
I'm just trying to play the game.
What?
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
No problem.  We're in.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
It worked out alright, didn't it?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Do you like my dad?
Congratulations, dad.
What are you doing up?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Who told you that?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Anything?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
How long she been dead?
Well?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Then I'll transpose.
It's a good play, but risky.
About what?
Do you always open quickly?
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
Do you?
Relax.
I know you didn't
Why?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Alright.  What about me?
She died in a car accident.
It was.
What?
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Fine.
Nothing.
Hi.
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
You're going to be late for your match.
It's over now.
I'm not nervous.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Where is the Fortress?
Yes.
That's a better one.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
They know when they're going to die?
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
Yes.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
The spiral begins in the west.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not worth returning to?
Once is enough, thank you.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Go, join them.
What is that awful looking place?
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
He didn't join them. They joined him.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
Each to his fate, lad.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
I was beautiful then.
She bore you many children?
Do not try your trickery on me!
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
Mathilda? May I come in?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
...Don't you drink?
How many girlfriends did you have?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
...Yes?
...Who sent you?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Salute.
This smells good.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
Nothing's going to happen.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
Mine.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
So what's the deal Maurice?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
I've seen it before.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
I do love you... very, very much.
Walk with me?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Why there?
Red flag, man.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Are you firing me?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Are they standing?
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
What's your shoe size?
What do you want?
Are you working?
I sometimes fade out.
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
Don't run away.
Thank you. What time is it?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Hi!
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Why?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I like it here with you.
What did they look like?
How'd this happen?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Don't hit me.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
I'll take that as a no.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Where you got in the shower.
Come again?
Huh?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
What are you talking about?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Uh -- both?
Yes?
Yes?
-- his life?
How'd it go at the trial?
You can't go home!
It's not my alibi to tell --
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Good luck.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Aside from that.
Why?
And you know this for a fact?
Okay, how would it work?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
What the hell is that for?
Up for a celebration dinner?
Someone missed you.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
What're you doing here?!
Neither.
It's pink.
Amazing how?
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Pink ones.
She's naked.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Hovering?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
What?
We go out, smash 'em now?
And you... are you not also afraid?
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Beware.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
My God!  Look!
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Is she... dead?
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
There isn't much time!
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Will you explain what's going on?
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
You see!  You see!
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Dolt!
You promised!
Liar!
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Where are you going?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Its powers are strong.
Lili!  No!
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sunlight?
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Pinching?  Where?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Sigurd's sword...
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
How do I get the horn back?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Courage, Jack.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
And charmed, of course.
Wondrously so.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
I'm promised to another!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What do we do now?
Where?
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Sorry, Jack.
Uhm... fine work.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Lost?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
He must.
Why?
Hey.
I don't know.
I can't even take a shower here.
I might not stay, anyway.
Huh?
Why are you so uptight?
You'd hate him for the trick.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
He's at work while I'm here.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
That would take weeks.
I'm good, thanks.
Pardon me?
Maybe...?
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
I didn't recognize you!
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I did warn you.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Because I live there.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I'm not going!
Are you totally insane?!
Probably in the bible.
I hate turkey.
It bugs me.
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
Where is it?
You can't make me do a thing.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'll have to pay him back.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
Hi, Alyssa.
I know parts of who you are.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I wish you had told me then.
What would you be doing now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
After everything.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
I aimed high.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
God, you look like crap, George.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
Kurt's been feeding him.
I was parked in day parking.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I used to live here.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I'm married.
Is your back still killing you?
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Are you going to kiss me?
Been thinking?
Nothing.
I wasn't sure.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
What the fuck?
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You never really trusted me.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
You got a dog?
Do you know anything about building a house?
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
All day again?
No, nigger.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Yeah...
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Like this?
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Guess we better get going, huh?
You lost all our money in a card game?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
You still got that map?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
You drew this?!
Come on, Ray, time to go!
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
I know people.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
What?!
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
I can't do it.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
It's too late for plans.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
He's from New York City. That one, too.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
They gave me life, mama.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
What's going on here?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Who?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Blacks welcome there?
Where'd you get this?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
All these good people have totally been led astray.
She goes to Parson's, right?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
I mean... tough break.
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Hey.
Thanks.
Bus?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Easy, Liberace.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Look who's back from the dead.
Schnapps...
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
So I followed him...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
You gotta kill yourself.
You got the wrong window again, man.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
You think I'm a tourist?
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Hey.
What were you thinking coming here?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Don't do it.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Why is that funny?
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
Where do you think we came from?
Answer the question!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
How did they get in here?
I am.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Why?
That was a great shot you made.
What's going on, Logan?!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Well then...?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I'm not armed.  Well?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
What Quad do you live in?
You could have called me yourself.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
About running, dying what?
And then you killed him, right?
Please? What friends?
I'd rather be with you.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
How do we know this is the right way?
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
Beloved husband...
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Goodbye.
How did you get here?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Where are they?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Can you make it back?
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Good... You up for a drive?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Listen.
I'm, okay... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Why not?
Why not?
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
You recognize that guy?
Hi.
Sure.
How'd it happen, Alice?
In pornos?
So, should I call Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Set.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
You got him.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah.
What night is that?
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
His condition? What do you mean?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Repeat that, Bill.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Yeah, Mack?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Do you remember?
What's the matter?
Who is it?
He's not Madison?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
No.
Who's it from?
Good book, huh?
When you didn't come to the club.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
You like pornos?
How ya doin', Pete?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Mr. Eddy?
Okay.
What are you guys doin'?
You want some company?
No... I told you.
I didn't know you cared.
Hey... Sheila.
Is it?
Yes.
He might have lost his way.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Yes.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
There you are!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Hey, what's happened to you?
If you want me to!
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
And mine's Conway.
Oh, yes.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Well, it must have taken–
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
When was all this?
He amputated his own leg?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Oh, immediately.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
You're lying, aren't you?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Sondra Bizet.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
He's dead.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
I'd go mad!
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
A man whose life was empty!
What is?
Ouch!
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
What is it?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
EXCUSE ME–
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
No. just peace on Earth.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Ha ha.  No, really.
What?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Now what?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Looks like a train ticket.
Kay--
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
What are you doing?
Since how long?
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
When?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Goodwill...
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Which way?
How's Dee?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
He's gone, too.
And they're buying it?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Where are we going?
-- but he didn't.
I put you away --
You made those tapes...
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John --
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Uh, sir...
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Go ahead.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
She was looking right at me.
She spoke to me.
Just go to the beginning!
Are you reading my mind right now?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
I scored a goal!
I won!
You're alive?
I forgive you.
Who are you?
Do you know who I am?
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Something wrong?
You don't seem all that proud.
Heal who?
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
What?
Why?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I believe in that system...
You want to bring it down.
You said they're destroyed.
How do I even know which one has it?
Oh, God, what did you do?
This is all my fault.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
He's trying to prove his innocence.
There a maid in this hotel?
John Anderton was my friend!
He looks familiar.
This your work?
Cream and sugar.
That was our apartment.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Yeah.
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
All the suites are about the same.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
It's on West Broadway.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
Oh no. What is it this time.
What the fuck was that about?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I'll support you.
Whu --
I said no touching.
What's your record at?
This is it.
A million. Easy.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
I didn't say that.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
A bad heart.
What's that?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
No. Just the cross streets.
I can wait around if you want.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Taken care of?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
We're with Ruiz.
Can you check?
Fuck them.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
I like it.
What? Did she say something?
Right here's fine.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
How much is it?
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
What exactly did they say?
Nothing else.
So they said more than the address.
This is bullshit, man.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
You know this guy?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
You fucking nuts?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
What the fuck was that about?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
The penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Wanna bet?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty five.
It's gonna be fine.
Dude, we were practically made...
Yeah. I want it.
Cardiff Giant?
Yes?
You strapped?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Stop.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
What do you want?
Coke?
Yeah.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Ricky.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
We're square.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Who's gonna outfit us?
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Man live by his rep.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
What you say?
You ain't lying.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
I don't know how.
Make it plain.
What points?
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Talk about what?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
We need you too!
Get some sleep.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Dear heart, where are you?
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
What color were the original Hebrews?
If you want to tell me.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
"His greatest greatness."
'Bout every other night, Red.
I better not come in.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
You the man.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
You want to be the head man?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Who's the boss?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
Who's he?
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
Were you provided with a gun?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
How long you staying, Crease?
What are you doing here?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
You mean a misfire?
Creasy?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
We're taking a different way home.
Did you like school, Creasy?
So you were unhappy?
And don't start crying.
What are you doing?
Do you think he'll come back?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
Rosanna Guerrero.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I think it's nice he's American.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
[Who's that?]
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I could see she likes you.
I'll call her up.
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Who you gonna call?
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Oh.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
No...
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
You say something?
What?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Don't worry about it.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Hello, Ma.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
It's loaded with what?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
I don't like her.
...and they sit down right next to me...
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
He coming home right now.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
So long, Ho-Jon.
What?
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Y'all just act natural.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Is that liquor?
I was just asking...
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Gimme three.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
What for?
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
We stand behind all our work.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Look.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
All of them?
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
How did you get called that?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
What's the story?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
In the direction you want to go.
How much time do I have?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
Yes, that's what I mean.
Sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Did you write this?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
How much money do you get?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
The letter.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Duets? But can we trust him?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Where's Connell?
Had any schooling?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
A what?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Sure.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Well, I don't get it.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Is there anything wrong?
Oh!
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Have you got the speech I gave you?
No -- you can't do that.
Not that we know of.
Floor seats.
Dinner's on you.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Where's the stereo?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Tell me what's wrong.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Hold on a second here.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
You don't have to come here.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
Satisfied?
What's the point of this?
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
What's the first commandment?
Yes.
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
I'm just practicing my lying.
He's got the girl.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Maybe you should be.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
What do you think?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
Stay here, don't move.
Yeah.
You crazy? With all those people around?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Any verification on numbers.
What have you promised them?
What do you want?
God-Damn you!
How come I can't remember?
It's all here...
The guests are here.
It's time to wake up.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
And what about the reconfiguration?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
What?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
One condition.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
There was no need to kill her.
An interface attendant.
I've got to get back.
Then how do you know about --
What?
It was just there.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Program name?
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
Wow.  Sand.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
... What's happening to him?'
I can hardly walk...
That's pretty bad.
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
I see... a fox
That's the only way to the Monolith...
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
... Not bad.
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
And how do we release the power?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
What is THAT!
THREE SECONDS!!
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Life knocked me back.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Bastard didn't even show.
You ain't even a man yet.
Well...
So you all make the same mistakes?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
You're getting' 10 cc's
You bastards, I said twenty!
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
I'm glad ya come.
This business is about taking risks.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
You get fifteen percent.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
The terms will be mine.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Strategy.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Special occasion?
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
What?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Death! Thank you!
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Uh huh. And?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Can't you give it to me later?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Stu...LOOK!
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Mother, I ...
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
Who is it?
Really?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But it *isn't*?
Tell me why!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Did you like the first act?
Any time.
No.
Where?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
All right, why?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
*But you never asked me*!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
A pet shop?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Where were you?
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Will the Senator--
Mr. President! A point of order!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Oh, now--
Yes, Ma?
Fine--
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Letitia.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Hello.
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Sure.
Oh--you are!
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Ax?
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Nice *compliment*!
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
Well--me, too!
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Yes.
Most every day.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
And you saw them happen?
You are , aren't you?
Tell me more about yourself.
Sure. I met you.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Really?
I've often thought about going back.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Ready?
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
What's the matter, hon?
People have been crucified before.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
You're a fool, Babe.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Look, I can do it!
Can I have a month's vacation?
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Did it?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
What're you going to do?
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Fourteen carat?
Stuff, sir?
Sit over there, will you?
Come on, John. What happened?
Relatives of old man Semple.
Your Honor, I object.
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
I can't find him.
Look!
Yes?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Will you have a cigar?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
I'm Chairman?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Now, where were we?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
No.
A what?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Proceed.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Where is your farm?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Hey, did you hear that?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
You can go out there if you like...
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Thank you.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
What are you doing for lunch?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
I see.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
What brought this on?
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
You do?
It was Henry Follett.
...so rich?
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Hiya, Doc.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What'd you want?
I think you do.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
We don't discuss it.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
It's all right.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Which thing?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
You feel violated?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Would you like another beer?
This is great!
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Who else knows?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
What about it?
And a birth certificate is enough?
Psych major?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Yes... your particular approach.
Who the hell are these guys?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
C'mon, friend.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
And what is he in prison for?
No women allowed.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
No?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Yeah, I was there.
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Something like that.
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
Got it!
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
You lied to me!
Juicy?
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Who's here!?
Where are you going?
I thought you were done?
We could really use some coffee --
Come on, baby!
How about... the Savage Six?
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Hey... you okay?
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
How's your dad?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Come here.
I'd better go.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
I'm liking this.
Have you ever seen him?
You sure that's how you spell it?
So what else has Superman got?
GET MAD!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Sounds good.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
The Obliterators!
Firepower costs money.
Wow.
So what can I get you?
Jeffrey!
It's on the television.
It is?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Hi.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Ah -- you approve?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
What do you mean?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
You realize what is at stake?
And who is defending Paris?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
No, they're living in Nice now.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Hello there, Picart.
How did it spread so quickly?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
And he sent you to me?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Thank you.
Thank you, Napoleon.
No -- not as a rule.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
I know of no better time.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
And now?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were any of them married?
She must have been in love with you.
Yes -- what is it?
Yes!!
Separate bedrooms?
That's all I can say.
Do you know what you're saying?
How do you know?
You could hear them?
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
What I am talking about is moderation.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Y'all never use it?
No.  Thought he was with you.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Fuck, what's his name?
Nobody!
What's crackin'?
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Who is that?
This you?
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You're welcome, Unc.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
You did all this for me?
Next time, page me first.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
What it smell like?
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Are they still out there?
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
What the fuck you looking at?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
My back.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Mr. Nasty time?
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
'S okay. What do you think?
Somebody close?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
Who did?
What?
Daddy?
You're out of your mind.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
I killed you.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
But...
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I have to do something.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Keep the change.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
You have, huh?
You got this under control?
Foreigners! Fuck!
And what happens if I don't call you?
Yeah.
Put her on.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
O, she's all right.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Uncle Birdie!
AAA-MENN!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Is he hit pretty bad?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Hing, hang, hung.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
Where's Mom?
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Are we goin' home, John?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
I'll see to Pearl.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What's taking you so long about it?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Nothin'. 
Can I have my supper please?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Them kids is yours?
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
It's just a stupid cat.
You okay?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Much better.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Rod's not a lunatic.
You used me, daddy!
Decide to take a day off after all?
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
I must be going nuts...
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
Give me the key, mother.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
I never touched her.
Someone else was there.
And then what happened?
Rod says the sweetest things.
Nice to have a fire.
When did you have a nightmare?
From Leon.
And you too, Ninotchka.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
Yes.
What is it, Anna?
You want this?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
He's cutting our throat...
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
Good morning, Your Highness.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
I am, Gaston.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
We can wait.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
Yes, Leon...
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
If you want to see us you must come later.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Bad news?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
We may have a chance.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
If there is anything we can do for you...
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Give me another double brandy.
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
In other words you don't know.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Why do you need my finger?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
And what do you do for mankind?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
You repeat yourself.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Do you hear that?
Oh, let it ring.
Then do it through my lawyer!
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Will you smile?
Just smile.
Because we are an odd couple.
Not funny, huh?
You see? Life can be so simple.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
How do you do?
Thursday.
I must talk to my brothers!
But, darling, you can't do that.
No speech.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Hello, Leon!
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Oh, Leon!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Make it ice cold.
Thank you.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
All right, I'll listen.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
You leave me no choice.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
Well... that's my business, madame.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Cigarette?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
We could check the tape again, sir.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
We could get that.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I agree it's ridiculous but --
I understand that, sir.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
It's a code or something.
Where's Hunt now?
Why not?
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
What about England?
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
What'd he say?
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
No.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
I never met the man.
We took his system out.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Why, you got a customer?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
No, Henry.  I don't.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
But it was all we had.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
... Use his women.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
Of them.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Yeah ... I'm out.
You don't have to go.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Buddy? ...
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
He looked old, didn't he?
Yes!
Congratulations, Dick.
Why didn't you?
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Won or lost?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
Some say you are, Rocky.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How fresh is this coffee?
That man that shot you died in prison.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
Nineteen zero and nine.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
He won't neither. He never has.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yes ma'am, I do.
Carla Jean...
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
...You ride Winston.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
How's that, Sheriff?
Yessir.
I put it in, Mama.
No.
You gave your word?
What's in the satchel?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
I need to know that.
Odessa.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Promise?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
I know where the money is.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
And where is that.
Did you go up to his trailer?
I can't say.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
What's this about?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
This. And the gas.
What way would that be?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Yessir.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
...What time do you go to bed.
Yes I do.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
One room, one night.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
...I'm wondering...
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
What about one forty-two.
That's me.
Half.
...But that won't last.
Took me about three hours.
What did you do?
Pot metal?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
The heroin. You don't have it.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Are you jackin' with me?
How is she?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
...plenty
Any idea where it is?
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Who are these idiots?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
The LeSabre!
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Why do they keep calling you George?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Lyla's very nice.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Thanks...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
Sure you don't want any salad?
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
What's the matter here?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
How did you know?
Dr. David Ravell.
What are you doing?
I got this apartment with a guy.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
The Five?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Doctor David Ravell.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Were you with him this whole time?
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Rosa, so you've met David?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Could you give us an example?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
What?
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
I'm not telling.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
What doesn't?
I never said that I believed...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
Seems like a nice place.
Jesus Christ!
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Can I have an evil twin?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
What did you say?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
You lie, motherfucker...
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Her show?
Yeah?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Huh?!
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Devil his due.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Where's your ring, honey?
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Pete... I do apologize.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
...Yeah?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
It's bona fide!
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Great ass.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
See you in the fleet, sir!
Louder!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Is your brother a flyer?
Vietnam?
Something tells me you've been here before.
You're sure it's okay?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
He ask you out for next weekend?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
You serious about having him over?
Lynette, where's Sid?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
I'm looking for Sid.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
That isn't true, is it?
Sid, what happened?
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
What?  What do you want me to do?
The hell does she want?
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
-- posed to mean?
Who is this guy?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
She said she did.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Be quiet.
Cell phone.
Yeah?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Master bath.
Could the child please stop that?
A what?
Push that button for me, will you?
Cut it back a little bit.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Makes me nervous.
Shoulda got an apartment.
478...
What?!
Fuck.
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Not an option.
What if I spazz out?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Tyrone...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
What the fuck?
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
So... we understand each other Judge?
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Get out of the car.
Inspector Brimmer
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
You got it. Berkeley?
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Rodgers... this is no good...
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
I saw... but...
What's up with you?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
You believe that?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
Am I one of that sort?
Well?
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
No, I don't.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Gray.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Put those away.
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Honey, Church will be fine.
Please hurry.
Yes.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Is he really all right?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
Yeah, sure.
I'm not tired!
Ellie--
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
God, that's fine.
Nice.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
It's Church.
Yes, but--
What say, Louis?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
It's funny, all right.
What are those for?
Doesn't look like they last long.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
The movers--
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
My God!
Getting there.
You stole my boat.
That boat is my livelihood!
No!  You gave your word!
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
No, I really think I do.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
There's ... another exit?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
The curse drove you to gather this?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
That would hardly be proper.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Difficult ... to say.
I know the code.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
I'm glad we got here in time.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Dead serious.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
What's your name?
You cheated.
Move!
I can get you out of here.
I'd die for her.
I swear, you look just like him.
No.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Are you certain this is the right way?
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
What did you use?
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Oh no?  Smell this.
She says it's not.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
It will be an ascension.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Hey!
Like Crazy Glue?
Nothing really worthwhile.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Susie!  You gotta help me!
They did it to me!
We don't have time for hysterics.
What are these?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
Just like old times.
What's wrong?
What's that?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
We've got to get the nanobot.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Will you step into the library?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Your place?
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Do you like them?
I know that.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
No? What do you look upon her as?
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Ah-ah-ah!
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Fine. Have a seat.
This way.
I knew your managing editor very well.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Look, I quit!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Come on, get going, get going!
It has been alleged - yes—
Not on my own beat, no.
Well, when are you quitting?
What play?
Araby?
Who are you?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
That's a canary, sir.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Thanks, thanks.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
How is her family going to feel about it?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Okay.
What do you know about Conrad?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
What could I be?
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Hello, Smith.
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
We just thought that—
Yes.
Okay - you remember Joe—
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Nobody seems to want to do anything—  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
And you struck him right here in our house—?
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
It's haunted just the same.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Mary Sue?
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Does it look okay?
Thank you.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Having kind of a tough time.
You can't go out there.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
What?
Sure is pretty.
I'm busy.
I don't believe it.
But it could happen.
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
Do you know that it's illegal?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Dan! Arrest them!
Hello Bud.
Noooooo!
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Can we do any better?
So what's the point?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
What did you do to him?
Me too. Sounds swell.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
Can I ask you a question?
Keeps going ...
So what's it like?
You want some berries?
Why would I do that?
EXCUSE ME?
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
There's worse places.
Bud?
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
You know what I really like?
Really?
It's an art book.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
It's beautiful.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
What city?
What's the listing?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
...please, I just don't want it....
You just said very food.
You look nervous.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
What's all this pudding?
Why's it here?
Goodbye.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Hello, this is Back.
No.
It doesn't matter.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Yes.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
You lied to me?
Hello?
They're not open yet?
Do you know them.
There's a piano in the street.
Hi.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
You like her?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
....No....
Is everything ok?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Did you pick it up from the street?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
I'll see you later.
I don't freak out.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Where do you have to go?
For work.....
I forgot about that.
Yes I'm sorry.
Did you have my home phone number?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your Social Security number.
You want her to call you Jack?
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
Now are you threatening me, dick?
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
I'll say whatever I want --
How many sisters do you have?
What's up?
Good morning, Barry....
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
No thanks.
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Where you been?
Yes.
Yes I am.
I won't.
I know.
I know.
I don't really remember that.
That's it.
Put him through.
I'll go pay for my car.
Yeah.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
So...did my brother call you?
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Ow!
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
I must grant him his last rites.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
They can't be serious.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
-- water! --
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Who's to say I did not?
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Abbe de Coulmier!
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
He'll do no such thing.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
But I am history.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'll pass the word on, then.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
It's a long story, this one.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
I am eternally in your debt.
Leave at once --
Ever met Walter Winchell?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Who are you, sir?
The actor
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
This picture--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
The great Spanish bullfighter
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Yes.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
I'll hire you  -- right now-
So, who is he? We have to know him.
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
You gonna watch?
Mank!
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
May I help you?
Very generous
To do what?
You're going to destroy it
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
For Christ's sake, shut up--
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
How 'bout a real drink?
Hey champ!
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
You want me to do what?
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Yeah --
Huh?
Do you see her yet?
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Say what you're gonna say.
Stick out your hands, Jake.
See? That's all there was to it.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Screw you, Jack.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
I did keep an eye...
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
But you said "you."
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Nine o'clock.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
You asleep?
Where you been all day?
What'd you see?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
Sure, what else is new?
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
What are you doing?
Hey, leave the kids alone.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
Name me a better photographer.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
Who said they left then?
If possible -- both.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Did you ever own a saw?
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Jeff --
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Can you get me that ring back?
I predicted it.
I knew it!
That's normal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
He and his wife splitting up?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
What are you two talking about?
No.
What do you need money for?
Ten here.
How's your leg?
And your stomach?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Make the one you want.
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
What is it you're looking for?
Yeah.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
I have the whole weekend off.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
Huh?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Shut up. I'm all right.
L. B. Jefferies.
What's that?
Meaning me?
Sure.  It's fine.
Any other entrance?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
What time is it?
Mother--
Will you let him tell it!
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
He depended on me.
You sure?
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
I was talking to Jim.
Are you going down there?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Come back tomorrow.
You scared?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Who has?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
It's me!
They're looking for you!--
Come out come out wherever you are!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Isn't it crazy?
We'll take it!
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
I don't want you for my father!
Plato?
Here.
You sure?
Can I keep it?
I shot at one of them.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
I'm sorry.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
No.
They never do.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Yeah--why--
They'll be looking for you.
It doesn't matter to them.
No--I was just--maybe--
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Where you going?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
What?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
No!
After he tried to shoot you?
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Do you think your father means that?
That one?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
A man of some travels.
Gabriel, you promised!
You promised me!
He wants... your "sister"...
Searching for a money man...
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
We sell children's toys --
Negative five?
I don't think it's negative five.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No --
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Ashley, Jesus --
You forget where I work?
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
No, Nick, no --
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
Get your own room, Ashley.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
You... you... YOU --
What?
But I never said Rudy.
No, you can't --
You what...
You're not Nick Mason...
So you could get with my sister.
So you could get down her chimney.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Where's she work?
What's her greatest fear?
You knew the place --
The hell you don't.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Hell. Ten?
So what the hell good are you...
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
You do.
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
No.
No way.
No, you're not.
Ash?
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Cancer-sucker.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
How long ago was your makeover?
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Tell her... I'll be there ...
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
That I should've picked you up?
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Daddy, did ya see that?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
A little.
The Brewers.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Didja use the commode story?
What's this?
Wong?
Mr. Blue's dead?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
What's she doin' now?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
What for?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
What the fuck are you talking about?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Want a smoke?
What's wrong with it?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
No real people?
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Nope.
So what is it?
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Of course.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Not these guys.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Who shot who?
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
It doesn't matter who they are.
What's the matter with her?
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Where do you keep the can opener?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Don't you trust me?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
I won't have you fighting over me.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
Who's Lednov?
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
I can't take her with me.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
Stop it -- stop it.
You got no business snoopin' around --
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Goodbye and thanks.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
We got to get movin'.
I said let's go.
Then I know my alphabet.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
That's it.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Really? That's amazing.
It's coming!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
You sure?
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Cindy, let me...
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Are you okay?
Oh, right.
Hanson, please.
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
That was a great idea, Shorty.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
I'm so glad you're here.
Yes.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Father, I think you should rest.
I woke up naked, too.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
Here we go again.
Hi!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Are you Chip Sutphin?
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Shhhh..
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
"P" as in...
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
So you do drink?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Man, that one made me puke!
Are we leaving?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
We can't stand here all night.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
Why, Mary --
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
What brought you down here, Greg?
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
But I'm not joking.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Well?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
And you knew he'd be here.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -— "My courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Wait —- there is that other favor.
Yes. When I tell you.
Perhaps.
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I was a great dancer...
Is it about Jacqueline?
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
You play an instrument?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Oh, uh-huh.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Mother, father, sister.
I don't know.
You are?
Does it bother you?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
What?
Aren't you?
So you don't believe in therapy?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
This is just... so...
How did you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
I can't.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Like maybe a big part?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
John?
Yes. I just got busy.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
You son of a bitch!!
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Because I never got around to it.
No!
Questions about sex.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Apparently.
Yes, I did.
What!?
Because I wanted to.
I wanted him to see me.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
No, but I did.
You couldn't do it, period.
I feel like I do.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Do you have my work number?
I just want to know why you're here.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
How do we start?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
No.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Not today. I've got other plans.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Hung up.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
What tapes?
Give me your keys.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
You knew these people?
Medical clinic?
Kiss, kiss?
Anything wrong?
Well? Supper at my place?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Can I call you at the office?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
Infantile regression.
Introduce yourselves.
I know, I know, it's just...
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
SPONSOR!!!
We're the experts.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
That's us.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Could you tell us a little about it?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
That's an extremely negative response.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
This could be worse than the old series.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Miles.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Glass or bottle?
They're from both of us.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Highliner, please.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Yeah.
Oh, that's tasty.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
What?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
How old's she going to be?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
That's what you do with every one.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Later.
Oh, boy.
Hey, there you are.
Does she know about Saturday?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Fucker hit into us.
I said okay?
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Let me use your phone.
What's that supposed to mean?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Well?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Fucking chick's married.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Yep. Quite a day.
What the fuck!
Look at this!
Well. That about does it.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Love you, man.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
What are you drinking?
Oh yeah? How is it?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
Is she sleeping or...?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
I had class.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Were you ever going to say anything?
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Oh, Maya. No.
That was big of him.
How much skin and stem contact?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
You talked to Wendy?
What's the matter?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
No.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
Hi sweetie.
You do?
Five. The five longest.
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
Do you feel comforted?
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Chicken Teriyaki.
They're on the roof.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He was only a year and half old.
I can feel air.
It's getting stronger.
That's good enough for me.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Dad.
They'll read our minds!
You said something was strange. What's strange?
What about them?
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I don't think so.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
All I did was kiss a girl.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
...Gotta go...
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
Goodbye?
Are you all right?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Offend anybody lately?
South of here, past Chimayo.
What's Turley like?
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
New record.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
What about his brother?
Hello, Cobb.
You've got a legitimate job.
You got a place to stay?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I'm going to have to look into this.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
What makes you say that?
I've got a place I can hide her.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- It's called a projector.
Where is she?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
... Simone.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I just read somewhere --
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
You can't.
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Your mother couldn't make it?
She still with Kent?
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Nice boat, Taransky.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
You did create me.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
I didn't know you were funny.
...No.
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
--What?
Don't cry.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
I wish I were somewhere else.
They're right here.
You can see her?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Fuck you.
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Aha. The Lovers.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Sounds familiar.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Are you crazy?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
He means moon shining.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Sure. What do you want to know.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Shit!
Yes!
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
What are --
I almost thought for a second...
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Carl.
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
What are you doing?!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
What?
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Meat.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
You're my princess, aren't you?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Where'd he go?
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Why? You have a bowling date?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Seriously?!?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
See ya, Kate.
By stealing my car?
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
What kind of a guy is he?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Why are you stopping?
He's just exhausted.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
See ya, Bandit.
No what?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Or in the slammer.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Also boring.
What are you doin' now?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Bandit I, do you copy?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
I hate to say it...
Never mind. It's nothing.
We're outta motion lotion.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
I'm all ears.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker. Breaker.
I think you're just yellow.
This is Bandit I. Over.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
How bad?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
You're sure?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
I'm here, where's the car?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
I could have it sent out...
I am. Yeah.
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
It's the last place they'd look.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Shoot.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
-- never in a million girl --
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
Why?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
Gibarian.
You'll end up like me.
I want to hear your version.
Where's his body?
That's fantastic.
You killed her!
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
How long can you go without sleep?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Probably.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
What plan?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
I need to see Snow.
Not a very happy poem.
I wasn't.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You're better when you take them.
What do you remember?
Is it intelligent?
Then it's God, right?
What happened?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What happened to us, exactly?
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
He has a point.
Who have you been talking to?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
Can you sleep?
You don't want me.
You said he was dead.
What do I have to do to stop it?
You're lying.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Gibarian was under enormous --
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Occasionally.
Straight ahead.
Uh...
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Put it on my account, please.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Let's get a drink.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
What about Neil?
You asked.
Claire?
When can I see you?
I'll miss you, Mike.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Mike?
My ass is falling.  It is.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
So how'd it go?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
What about when she goes out?
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Not Koontz.
No, I will not step outside.
How do I know that's her?
Why should she come in?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
How do you know where the gun is?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Cause if you get in a bind--
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Now tell me you love me.
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
What's this? A cockaroach?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Some things you should say anyway.
Good morning, Liz.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
Well, no.
Toxic dumps, huh.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
So they're airing this tonight?
You're sure you're all right.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
They never caught on.
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Come on!
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Break it off!
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
I'll live.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
It is.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Jawohl!
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
You'll fix me up!
You did?
What do those broads say?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Do Grable.
May I have this dance, Miss?
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
What are you going to do?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
What about Schulz?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
How do they know?
Who did?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
I'll kill you for that!
The what?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
We have no radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
What guy?
I'll make it five hundred!
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
This is me in Cincinnati.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
Target their Bridge.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Data?
What do you mean?
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
This is its current position.
Are any of them inhabited?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Really? What do you feel?
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Sir?
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
It looks like we're too late.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Status!
Tractor beam, aye!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Will we get another ship?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Still no response, sir.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Aye sir, coding now.
Why don't we beam it up?
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
My readings indicate great instability.
.          .. Spock's tube...
Later. Let's go...
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Did your collaborator know?
I don't understand.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Captain, what's happening?!
Good shooting, Scotty.
How many more?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
What happened...?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
The word, sir?
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
See! That shimmering area.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Yours...?!
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
Give me your hand and we both live.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Then, how --
He asked you not to grieve...
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
So!  Speak!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Physician, heal thyself.
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Uh -- what are they?
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
Shore leave, Admiral.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Khan could be down there!
Until now.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
... taking Genesis away from us...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
You did this -- in a day?!
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Does that about do it?
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
David --
Jim --
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
You're crazy -- !
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are you looking at?
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're still running with shields down.
Well?
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Tactical!
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Thirty seconds...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
And who is this?
Is the word given?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
I would not presume to debate you.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Carol Marcus --
They knew just where to hit us.
The prefix code?
That's it?
Uh oh.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Khan!
Indeterminate life signs.
How?
<u>WHAT</u>?
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
I can't get power, sir!
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Sir, you did it.
Prepare for warp speed.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Oh, joy.
What did you say she was getting?
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
... I don't think he understands...
Fundoscopic examination --
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Ah, well done, team 2.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's that?
Wanna try it from the top?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Here... In the park?
... Gone?!
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Where are you going?!
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
The late 20th Century.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Spock...
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
I meant --
Status?
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Systems report.  Communications?
What is it?
Any luck...?
Bearing!
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Transparent aluminum?
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
Deceive us?
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Will it?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
I have to go home now.
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Yes... that looks like them.
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
You're not going to launch anything until...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
My name is Sojef, Captain.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
You need a haircut, Commander.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Initiate launch sequence.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
You think they're still up there?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
How long has he been unconscious?
Do you know what this is, Data?
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Dispersive armor is holding.
What year is it?
Who are you?
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Juice?
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
Main bus...
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
There is no invasion...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Friends from Cornell...
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Good luck, sir.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Wil... Data was down there.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Mr. President.
Good luck, Captain.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Are we playing multiple choice?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
My God, what happened here?
WHAT HAPPENED?
He's a DOCTOR!
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Spoken by you?
For insubordination.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
An INCIDENT?
Isn't it about time you became something else?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
Stand down your weapons.
I always wanted to try that.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Me?
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Spock, I'm really tired...
What the -
Close enough to beam down?
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
If you are logical.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Why?
I do not understand.
No. I must deactivate you.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
How long does he have?
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
So... To happy endings.
And this makes you "sad"?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
A weapon.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
How long until we reach the fleet?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
How can you be sure?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
What is our approximate distance?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
No.
If you wouldn't mind.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
No.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
So, human... you've met your better self!
I won't do it.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Sir?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Report.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
But she's not the Enterprise.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
We need to talk, just you and I.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
You don't trust me.
With a full head of hair.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
What are you doing?
All of this so you could capture me?
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Not so long.
It’s too late.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
This is a mistake.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
The bond is broken.
How long until we reach the Rift?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Right in line with that burning tree.
Benny, there's nothing there.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Credit card.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Where did you stop last?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
It's real, George.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Hello George.
That's the chance we have to take.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
George... Do you hear me, George?
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Please...
Gear shift.
What?
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Closed?
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
No.
Money.
Why are you going here? What is here?
Sun...
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
Eh... yes...
But I must go here.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Well... I'm going to go now.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
I like this music.
You can have one.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
I will go. But not you.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Where are you going?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
What are you saying?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
This is yours...
What do I do now?
Help me!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Help me!!!
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
Is it for real?
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
No, sir. Radar.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Where are you going?
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Yeah, that's right.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
You can't just... kill him.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
You talked to Iris?  When?
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
What?  Right Here?
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
So've I.  Too much.
Top ten.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
What stuff?
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
So there never was a death squad.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
About what?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
What's his name?
That would be no.
Forget her.
Is this great fabric or what?
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
How's Zander?
Lenny, give them the tape.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Tell me.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
You see Tran?
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
Right.  That explains it.
Was this him?
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Dylan here.
You have the body?
What?
Excuse me?
Look, mister...
My God.
What did he look like?
He was sitting here?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Do you think he singled you out?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Yes I do.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
He thinks he looks young.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
It's a no-no.
The tattoo?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
And nobody else can do that?
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
It's quite advanced.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Who are you?
How's the arm?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I want to help you.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
No.
"MyDick?"
I don't...
I don't think you understand.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
You should call your Grandmother.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Hi.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Charles! What's up, man?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
You haven't told then, huh?
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
On the table.
Huh?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
It's a rebound.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Well... This is it.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Well, I should be getting...
How are you doing?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
Hi.
Well that sucks.
Unless she comes back first.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
I mean, I need the money.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I'll give you an eight. 
Kinda money, huh?
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
Him?
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
They turned you down?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
You miss the pain?
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
Pause it. 
What's he do?
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Hello?
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Wait.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas, baby!
They're all skanks.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
That's where we make our scene.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
She likes you.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Sorry about interrupting...
Christy was nice...
No. Doesn't that suck?
You guys are such assholes.
...against the computer.
Is she looking now?
It's on.
You're money.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Sue...
The bear's got his claws back.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No.  You ask for too much.
Be my friend.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
You take care of your family?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
What was this for?
What miracles you do for strangers.
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
Barzini will move against you first.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Corleone.
Things went badly in Palermo?
What is it?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
What was that?
Will you give this to him.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
They're talking to themselves.
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
Michael?
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
When will I see you again?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
How do you do.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
Shut up.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
You're breaking my ribs!
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
I know. I write like a child.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Freddie?
He's downstairs.
What are you talking about?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
What?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Hello?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Freddie, do you have something to say?
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
That ring's so great. The green one.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Hello Marge.
He hates being confronted.
Did he kill Freddie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Where does Dickie live?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
I found Dickie's rings.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
I told you! I knew it!
How would you know that?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
Where's Dickie's father?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Ditto.
We'll be there.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
And don't forget. I have the key.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
It is a little coarse, yes.
Absolutely.
Is there a firing range around?
Why?
I don't know...
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
That's really something.
Huh?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Damn.
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
No, why?
What taxi driver?
How long has he been there?
This I gotta see.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Why you hang around with them greasers?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
That ain't much of a name.
What's your real name?
I don't remember.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do they drug you?
Can I see you again?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Why?
I sure hate to go alone...
There must be something...
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No, I want long shifts.
Sure.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Travis.
Had a close one.
Spit it out.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
Limp dick?
What are you doing?
Wait.
God's speed.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
What about you, Delly?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Did you bring along something to read?
I see you got the telegram.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
City hall?
Whoa.
What was that?
Were we going to get married?
Nine hundred...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
They're not bad.
What... do you remember?
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mother o'god...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Didn't you have any help?
They couldn't wait to see you.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
But I...
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
You bet.
Well...
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Ha!
Luke... what time is it?
I'm here.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Any idea how you got here, son?
What's wrong?
You kids off to the dance?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
You should watch what you say.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
You can't testify.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
When'd you quit smoking?
Why not?
Not at all.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
That was beautiful.
What happened?
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Will you help me, Sandy?
Ancestors?
You hungry, son?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
I was wondering...
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
And what had you done?
Then what was it?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Yes.
They haven't harmed anyone.
Are you coming to my party?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
I wonder if you could help me.
Yes, but where?
Are you sure?
Yes?
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Gulls!
A what?
You did say birds?
In a bird shop.
She was selling birds.
Yes?
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
They won't be.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Where's Mitch?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
No, of course not.
Doesn't what make me...?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
I think you're a louse.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What kind of law?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Ouch!
Why... 
We... we went to school together. College.
Can't see a thing.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
And you didn't come up here to see her.
What did it say?
Why?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
What do you mean?
Melanie...
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
I think it's safe to get out now.
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Have we still got power?
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
There we are!
Have you got a pencil?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Yes, certainly. 
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Birds?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
I'm only a student.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
But you did promise.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Yes, I suppose so.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
We can't be sure of that.
She's unconscious.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
This is not a woman!
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
No.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
But what makes a thought start?
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
But why, Gray? Why?
A pleasure to torment me?
What did you hear?
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
But can anything be done for her?
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Crony indeed!
I hate that picture.
I was hoping you'd find out.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
The scar. Which of you has it?
You're him. Corvis.
Daisy. How did you know?
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Erin. It's not your fault.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
They botched the execution.
Just don't believe everything you see.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
Anything wrong?
But you, you've had them.
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
What? What is it?
I think I dropped an earring.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Such power exists?
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Did all these people die in wars?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
I don't believe it.
How does he explain that?
The present situation?
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
I don't know how to thank you.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
Just twelve.
Why not?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
But how -- how long--?
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
Is it worth anything?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
Well... we blew Plan A.
All together?
Did you see that sucker burn?!
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Leave him alone.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
He's not glowing.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Of course not!
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Thanks, Grandpa...
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
You didn't tell David?
You like Michael.
He looks dead.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Okay?
He met a girl.
Lights out, Sam.
You're cute, Max.
Not impressed, are you?
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
I'm really sorry, Max.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
But you passed the test!
Ouch.
Let's go see them.
I know, I've felt it...
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Where are we going?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
What you doin'?
What?
We got to burn 'em.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.  Now...
You catch anything he was saying?
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
Where's the other half?
We should have jumped his ass.
Spaceship of some kind.
My God, what in hell happened here?
Would that test have worked?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
How long's it been?
Four!
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What if it doesn't come?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
What's happened?!
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
What do you do on the towers?
But you escaped.
We need your help.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
What's your name?
No, we created the Morlocks.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
We make them see what we wish.
And what of the Eloi?
Say I just come back again?
Why?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
It's spectacular...
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
You're late.
You promised me flowers.
Well there's something new.
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Alex... people are staring.
I was not.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
You wouldn't believe me.
I can't do that --
Good night, David.
This... was my home.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Is there a lot of illness?
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Good night, then.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Yes!
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
I don't understand.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Alexander...?
Yes... I suppose so.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Relax.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
[Beat] You're his son?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
Do I know you from somewhere?
My father used to talk about you.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
I think I can remember what's on them.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I looked it up.
Do you really believe me?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
They're not here.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
I think so.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
I don't understand.
You were convicted of the crime.
Why, what would you do?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
You don't understand.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Why not?
And how do you know that?
I tried to kill my wife.
What were you talking about the other day?
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
I'm not sure.
Well, where are you from?
Well, how'd you get here?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
What's this?
You like it?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Have a good day at work today.
Honey?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I've been better.
No!
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
What kind of gun was it?
Good God.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Is that how you answer the phone?
Who did it?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
Exactly.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
It means shut up, Thelma.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I wish we could've brought him with us.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
He's got a lot to be proud of.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
It won't work.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Now what?
Whaddo we do?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
What?
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Ready?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
I said all that?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
No.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
What in the hell is it?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
Then let's not get caught.
You women are crazy!
Oh, Jesus!
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Stop it!
Gay? He said you were gay?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
No You mean...?
Shoot.
Got cash.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
We're in love with your roommate.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Don't you want to know my name?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Fine. Fine.
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Fuck!!
Are you okay?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
She's blackmailing you, right?
Four kids, three different guys.
Miami?
Jai alai?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
How many is that?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh... Sully.
Oh. Well I am.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Have you been up all night again?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
An old flame?
You don't think they're too big?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
What's up?
I think you'd better sit down.
So who you taking to the prom?
The prom -- you going?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Are you all right?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Twenty-two.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
No! I was pissing!
Hey.
Eh.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Franks and beans!
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
Well, I'm not.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Slow down. Smell that?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Max.
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
I see.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
What'd she say?
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Her oil pan is shot.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Alright. Alright...
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
What's he smoke in that?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
So what?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Cuz I'm a skin?
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
What's that?
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
I desecrated it?
What?
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
No way. No fuckin' way.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
I thought he'd never leave.
It never came up.
What would?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Harmless!
Why'd you do that?
And now I want you.
Just good luck.
No.
Want to play the game?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
I know exactly what you mean.
Tomcats?
Yes, Sergeant?
Sir?
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
I'm pulling up.
Ohhh Mother!
I've got it -- hold on!
Is it you?
What do you want?
Did what?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
You ever done this before?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
3000 feet. I'll do it.
That's Kazanski.
A plaque?
No, we...got our butts kicked.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
You saved our lives. You did it!
Who is the best.
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
I can take care of myself.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
You may not think so, but you are.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
What happened to them?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Shut up and drive!
What do you want?
I'll go encode your room key.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
I'm with an very important client.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
What, aliens?
Why not?
Where?
I want that fucker dead.
Shit!
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a weak signal over there.
I've got a lock!  There!
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Would you please repeat the destination?
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Let me go!
What are you doing?
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Let me finish!
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Clever girl.
I love you.
All right.
I give up.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I love you.
Forget I said wife.
Don't be ridiculous.
So you dropped by to apologize?
Now what?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
I don't need Kuato for that.
What reactor?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
What's wrong?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You guys all set?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
Fuck you!
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
What the hell are they?
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Its tires are flat...
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Watch your ass, shithead.
Somebody paying you to do this?
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
We playing cards tonight?
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Burt!  Heather!
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
The con...!  Oh my God.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
It worked!  There they go!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Ms. Vin's sister.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
We have a full caseload, Rog.
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
Eddie Dowd.
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
-- Eddie...
...Jesus!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
My mother find you?
No.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
I see: He'd walk out next month.
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
It's okay. It was always like that.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
I'm nearly out.
Here he comes.
Let's ditch this place and party.
We can do it right here.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
You try that you little monkey.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
What did Gordon's tie mean?
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
Noooo...
James called me last night looking for you.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
Laura?
Do you want to talk?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
You want a muffin?
Where are the Cookies?
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
Laura, do you love me?
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
I've got to see you.
What about tonight?
What's going on?
When he finds out.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Where's Dad?
Dad.
School?
Let me see.
Who was that?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Dad?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
...tell me about this case.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
What is the truth?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
You would not...?
They lied.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
How is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Ed Concannon.
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Thank you. When Debby...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am seventy-four years old.
She getting good care over there?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Dr. Gruber...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
Yes.
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
The most respected...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Thank you...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
A single hour.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Really. How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Why don't you get some rest?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Joe...  Joe...
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Dr. Gruber.
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
I want to buy you a drink.
...now who is that...?
I have to talk to you.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
There's nobody left around here now.
Did you see it come down?
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
You seem to know a lot about him.
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
They've all stopped at the same time.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
Nothing there now.
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
What is that gizmo?!
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Must be somebody in there.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Can I read it?
So I don't know about horror.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
What if it isn't over?
Guess so.
What's up?
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Like Freddy.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Yes.
Diabetes?
Does he have to stay here over night?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Tomorrow night.
Who?
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Home.
You okay, champ?
Dylan, where's the man?
What...what is that?
You're not crazy, by the way.
Seemed, not was.
I've never mentioned it to him.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
I know how Chase really died.
Heather, what is it?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Me?  Why me?
That was Nancy, not me!
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Robert?  I...
Yes?
Now?
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
What are they doing?
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Albatross?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
He does.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
You only hurt yourself you know?
But that's not the point...
Ya know... "It".
So... What happened?
It was so real...
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
But you invited is aboard.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Spying?!
Oh, really?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
Immortality.
What's that?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Don't ever call me stupid.
I don't.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
What do you think?
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
Swing up, son.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
They are much more than that, sir.
Yes, that's true.
Yes.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
What's Cao Ben?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No.
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
You heard from Reggie?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
So, it's back to the islands.
The Good Witch...
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
What is it, Johnnie?
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Hey baby...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
You're perfect for me, too.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
That don't seem fair.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
That don't smell like a More.
They sure do stink.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
You got me, peanut.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Who do?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
How much we got left, honey?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
How can you say that, Sailor?
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
What do you want me to do about it?
You need to explain it.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
You really are one dumb asshole.
I know... I remember.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
You all right, Professor Tripp?
You snore.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
I just mean...
He said something about being between things.
Trip??
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
So whose car is it?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
You peeked, didn't you?
You driving this car?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
I passed out.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Vernon.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Who the hell is that?
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
...reconcile with Emily.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
They're glass. The buttons.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Oh.
Want me to get that?
The guy on the phone.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Afraid so.
Washed up?
How did I get here last night?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Isn't this...?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
It feels really... good... here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
What?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Thanks for that. He all right?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
You go first.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Not have it.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Oh?
Someone stole my car.
He told you.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
Ouch. How many?
I guess you have to go on faith.
Does he still love you?
Did you just make that up?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Who's this ?
Yo, Traxler.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
There's so many...
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
Soon.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
There's a million birds here.
How does it sound?
You should hear the bird.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
I think you do.
I would.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Okay?
Too much sun.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
I'd say you're moving.
Are you taking your medication?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Walter.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Yes.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
And how's your job?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
It was just an idea.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
That's right.
It's very good, indeed.
How's the journal?
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
How do you feel about that?
Then why are you talking about this?
Is that what you are angry about?
I mean, when will I be normal.
You couldn't say.
How do you define it?
I don't know.
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
To relax.
No, I am not going to --
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Sorry.  Where is she?
But roughly, how old?
And what are you doing?
A nap?
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
What else?
Want a ride?
Southern light.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Doesn't it get noisy?
They could eat you.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Do you?
Tell me about it.
How about in the morning.
So, what did you do?
You're not joking.
Sorry.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
I've changed.
Being here, with me.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
All three -- in chronological order.
I love my brothers.
We should live together.
I say we call it quits.
What's this?
Don't be scared, Walter.
Sneak up behind me like that.
What's going on?
I didn't sleep well.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Where are we?
I'm taking you back out.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
What about O-2?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Son of a bitch!
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Hello, Brigman.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Y'all could be more specific.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Uh, oh...
When do you have to go back?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
A little more so this time.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
Used to what?
Well?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Find anything?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Claudia, listen to me...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Does it please you to say such things?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
That's why I asked you...
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Good night, my love.
I don't love you.
Do you consider that a compliment?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Please, you come too...
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
I'll stay here also.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
You men are all so dreadful!
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Anything new develop?
But where did you come from?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
I don't know.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
I just heard you.
Well, who in particular?
Uh huh.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Where do you meet?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Something I ate.
I went to my room.
I got sicker.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
What's your real name?
Are you married?
Would you like some?
One.
Where do you think babies come from?
You liked Sister Paul?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Did your mother see angels often?
And you're unhappy.
Sometimes, yes.
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
She can't hurt you any more.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
Yes?
She tells you you're ugly?
That you're a mistake?
Why?
Oh, yes.
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Agnes, you're stupid.
I really love you.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Will she be angry?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
For me to get sick in.
Of what?
Who?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
She'd seen him too.
For what he made me go through.
I hate him.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
What did you do?
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Thanks. 
No, no, no...
No!
Marie's dead Mama.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
And you didn't try to find out who?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
I believe Agnes is different.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
That's absurd!
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Shortly after she came to us.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
Not simple, no.
It's my affair too.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
What?
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Do you think they ever existed?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
May I be present?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
This is permission to take her apart.
Was it you?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Too late for what?
You went to the room to help with the birth.
You wanted that child out of the way.
You tied the cord around its neck.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
I'm a deserter.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Why aren't you at work?
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
We're nearly there, sir.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Me? Why?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
And what do you do about it?
Yes.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
What are they saying?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
That little old man.
I hope he fell off.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
No.
Now get on with it.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
It'll only get you into trouble.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Where's my grandfather?
That's mine.
What do you think are you're up to?
Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
How's that?
Eh, what's all this?
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Locked.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
I got it.  Oh boy.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Just machinery.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
How do you feel, Dell?
A transmission?
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
What do you mean?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
It's clear.
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Yes?
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
<u>How</u>?
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Can you get them back?
What?  What was that?
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
Look at that.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
That way.
What'd he say?
<u>What is it</u>?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
How?
And what do we do when we find it?
They're on the next level up.
They're getting pretty close now.
Okay.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
What the hell happened?
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
What film?
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
No... don't...
Headache?  Dehydration?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
What do you need?
How many of them are there?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Oh, man...
How much air-time have I got?
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
De Vries?
Whoa, wait a minute...
Forget it, man.
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
And...?
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
There's still time to back-out.
Okay, we're in business.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
That's the wrong way!
How's it going?
You're more than modest.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Hungry?
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
I didn't mean just the Theater.
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
Because I don't want to.
Let's go sit by the piano.
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Didn't you know?
When? When are you going to do it?
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Need any help?
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I will not calm down!
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
Don't run away, Bill.
You hear all kinds of things.
Lemme fix you a drink.
The same size?
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
She works hard.
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
That's all.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Not at all.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
You're not going, are you?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
You won't forget it?
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Eve... don't cry.
She knows enough not to be here.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo, really...
What about Bill?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
That's on time for Margo.
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
Lloyd, be careful...
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
I never said it was!
Yes, sir.
That depends.
"Liebestraum."
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Are you breaking the contract?
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
All right, what do we know?
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Hey?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
July of '71.
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
See her?  Get anything?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
Anything you've got.
I hate both parties.
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
What does it say?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
Tell that to Muskie.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
Can't help you.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
Speak.
What's a real denial?
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
FBI too?
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
So tell me about the Times article.
Who by?
Right.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--I saw him. He verifies.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Where in government?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
Anything?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
That was awhile ago.
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--which Young?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
Does "they" mean the White House?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
What the hell was that?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Do I have to?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Onions?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
So we're gonna be close next year?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
What about the game?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
What?  We both have cars.
You got it, stud.
No you haven't.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Can I come in?
Dad!  I know!
Jim?
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Dad!!
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
So you need to change, right?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Uh...
Oh...ungghhhhh!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
That's my trick!
Like how?
I think you're so right, Kevin.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
What reputation?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Merde! Just missed!
Merde! I can't believe this!
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Sure. I can follow that.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Don't you want to change?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Serafine...
I hope they fucking fry us all.
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
We don't both have to die.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Pull over! Now!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Claude...?
The ADM. Let's go.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
We know you were with her.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Uncle Terrence.
Jesus...
What do you mean, maniacs?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Shit. I feel sick.
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Enough. Cut him loose.
Now!
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
We're just going to refresh your memory...
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Why do you want to go to Paris?
You never thought of the possibility?
By pulling my hair?!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
I'm so scared...
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I'm getting a chest cold..
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Hurry up with those papers.
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
What do we do now?
See? The Princess is under there ...
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Hey, you on television?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Hey!
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You're like New York. You're an island.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Lyndon Johnson?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Stop it, Alvy!
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
So sorry.
Right!  Where?
For yuh.
All right.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Huh?
You want your tennis stuff?
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Oh, I see, I see.
Oh, thank you.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
I know.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Yeah?
Gimme a kiss.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
And we'll digest our food better.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
H'm?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
Hey?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Look at these guys.
No, I'm not.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Yes, it is.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
What are you doing?
Really?
Oh, you have my body.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Well, what is your definition of following?
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
It's his name.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Will it change my life?
What?
Oooh.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Is he in the bathroom?
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Okay, let me have this.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Check it out.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Yeah, this place is great.
Oh, good. Okay.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Alvy.
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Where are you going?
Probably on their first date, right?
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Well, sit down.
How about a ginger ale?
There are no twos, Max.
So the colored have enough trouble.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
M'mmm.
Oh.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
She already has.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
I don't know how to make her funny.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
You should have brought him.
Would you leave us alone right now?
That for us?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Escape hatch.
But she's alright.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah?
I call that a perfect day.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
It was fifteen seconds.
I'm fine, babe.
We closed.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
You only made half your quote this year.
We'll be fine.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
I mean, you're really back.
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Two minutes.
Still champions.
It's an unfair advantage.
She left the fucking gate open.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
About me!
I don't look my age, Joe.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
That's under lock and key.
Happy anniversary.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
I know.
Has she called?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
And I you.
Ours.
You got your DP?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Sally did all this herself?
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And Ryan works at home.
I need to leave you now.
Yes.
I think there are sixteen there.
Of course it's alright.
What?
How's he doing?
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Ready to go?
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Is there space here?
I was impressed.
That was my clue.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Are you lovesick?
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Everyday.
Shit!
We're going to have to go back out there.
Nevermind.
It's much more personal in here.
Well good.  Thank God.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Break's over.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You're right!
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Out here I'm just what?
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Z!  what are you doing?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
Affirmative.
...Not enough food?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
So this is your mother's apartment?
What did I tell you?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Twenty-seven.
Good night.
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
What gave you that idea?
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
What is it?
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Who?
And where are you now?
His apartment?
Your stomach?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
No doubt about it.
Why not?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
What are you doing with that?
Thank you.
I know so. He's a taker.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Here.
I mean, after that?
We're going to finish that gin game.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Mind if I come in?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
You do?
How would you like to go tonight?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Well -- I guess so.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Now you're being bright?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
What are you going to do, Doc?
Want to tell me what happened?
What about him?
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Not so rough, honey.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
That guy really must've belted him.
What for?
You fool -- you damn fool.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Well -- thank you.
How long has it been -- a month?
I want you back, Fran.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
That's enough, Fran.
What do you think?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I have that date -- remember?
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Where are you headed?
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
Two whole drums --
We've been attacked.
Winning the war by yourself.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
So what happened ?
Arch light.
Why they call you that?
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Get in there !
They're not Cong.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Listen.
Anybody see some smoke ?
I only met Kurtz once.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Spooky.
What -- happened here.
Who is he?
How did they know?
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
No, sir.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
I think think a lie stinks.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Did you know him very well?
And you admired him?
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
You hear it again?
You think?
This boat's a mess.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Cognac?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
So that's it.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
That's 27, sir.
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
119  CONTINUED:  
165  CONTINUED:  
26   CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
How long have you been up north?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Be careful, okay?
Where's Corbett?
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
You're hurt.
Ben Corbett?
Desmond.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
Stay put!
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Stay still.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Go easy.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
You hear me?  Ben?
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
...Ben never sent a signal.
It's Sam Wilder!
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
I'm starving.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
Sorry.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Uh, Udall?
What's this?
The stiff one eye?
Hello?
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
Hello.
What do you want, Melvin?
What job?
Because...
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Was this supposed to be your room?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
What the heck are those for?
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
She's nice.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Good evening.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Actually, I don't think so.
How you doing, great one?
Sure thing.
What?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Which color was that?
Did you... do something to him?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Go away.
Please, just leave.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Would you leave now, please?
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
What did she say?
What's wrong?
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
How do you write women so well?
So you're practically finished, huh?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Is there a problem?
Uh, Fontella's
No shit.
What are you doing?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
What are you doing?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Game over, bitch!
Michael?
Such language in front of a lady.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Who is the mark?
What?
I work for the government.
Now what?
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Electra.
Had?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No.  Just the first one.
Good.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
I went into their room this afternoon.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Can I ask you something?
Is this becoming complicated?
Four minutes.
I'm taking off my mike.
I wasn't watching television.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Who's your friend?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
We're going to need it all.
Let's split.
So why didn't we?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, We aren't going to do it.
Damn!
Now you're using that word.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Yeah, no problem.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
Take this exit.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
It's that one isn't it.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Will it help to get you out?
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
About forty minutes.
Okay?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
Will this thing take long?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Better than you.
Enjoying our hospitality?
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
What is it you want?
And the students?
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
I think we should be going honey.
Come on Holly!
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
She asleep?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
'Bout what?
What are you doing here?
I'm thinking.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Landon!
Who are you?
You don't know me.
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
What's with the friggin numbers?
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
You have to believe to have faith.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
He okay?
What does that mean?!
Hey.
You're acting like a crazy person.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
We can measure wind.
What do you actually know with religion?
I might do it wrong.
What'd you tell your father?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Why didn't you tell me?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Help me live until I die?
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
How're you doing?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
This week.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
Huh?
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Who, me?
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Operator...
What, am I radioactive or something?
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Pro, the sun's out!
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
You answered the door!
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Obviously!  
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Gone?... Where?
Oh yeah?
Does he bite?
You like people?
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
What for?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
You still in school?
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
Hi.
Why?
You tired?
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Yes.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
What's that?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Yes.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Think I'll take the juice?
Not me. No way.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Planet 10?
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Where're you goin'?
And they got Penny!  Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Oh, my.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Never.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
What's his problem?
Pick those up, Reno.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Let him go.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
Well that's what he said.
I beg your pardon?
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
A souse!
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
What do you mean, Barton?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
...Barton, is everything okay?
Sound a little what?
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Howdy, neighbor.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
I hope these are your shoes.
How did you know about that?
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
...Can I come in?
Are you sure –
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
...I just don't know what... to do–
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
I – Mr. Lipnik –
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
Fink.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
...Those your only bags?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
So -- how are things?
How about the booze?
Catherine Tramell.
Why did you change your name?
You should do something about this lock.
What are you doing here?
Do you have a cigarette?
I told you -- I quit.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
How did you feel when he died?
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
How exactly did you hear?
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
What did you pay Nilsen?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
When did you write it?
How's your new book?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
What did you think?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
It's OK.  It's OK.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
Do you believe me?
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
How did he die?
It teaches you to lie.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
I never heard of him.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
I don't know.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I'm not afraid of her.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
He died -- about five or six years ago.
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River, New York!
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ten bucks apiece.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Cool.
Piss painting?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
B.B. It's me – Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
What are they?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Not what?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Who am I?
Check you later, man.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
I'm your family.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
What's wrong with me?
Don't you think he's using you?
Hi.
Some of them.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
So keep painting.
OK! Goodbye!
Uh-oh!
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Where's the fire?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
And the truth frightened her?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
... eight, seven...
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
I don't.  So, no.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
But I can't can I?
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
What is it?
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
This is easy.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
No sign of the snowman.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Make yourself right at home.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
It'll never work.
Why do I keep doing this?
There's one other thing. I feel..
...A bat.
All the answers are numbers.
What do maniacs always want?
And another name for Mystery?
Al?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Now black rubber.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
We'll talk some other -
La'chiem.
Rinka.
What do you know about obsession?
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Find anything interesting?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
...Not the bat?
Okay. I'm outta here.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
I'll show you it works.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
How'd you find us?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Holy shit.
No.  Wait...
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
How high up would you say that is?
Yes?
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Look! Police!
Can't we --
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
How'd you find this place?
Great.  Give me a grant.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
And what happens if we say no?
Joker here. Can we talk?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
... Thank you.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Yum, yum.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Peanuts?
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Not what?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Go ahead.
Hi,
shhh...
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Oh yes.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
It's very good Bernie.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Welsh again.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Well, there is that ...
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
This sucks.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
That was boring. Huh huh.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Uh... bye-bye.
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Really? I poop too much.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cavity search...?
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Not on him, Chief.
Do her? Huh huh.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
She sure does.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You'll be rich!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
What happened?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
What...?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
What is going on?
Help vouchers?
Are you available?
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Just get some people out of our house.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
How'd you do on the science test?
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
God, you're anatomically correct!
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
W... What is it?
Otho?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
What do you think, honey?
Where is your mother?
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Answer your mother.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
What do you think?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
What's happening to them?
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
I would like to walk today.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Do you know Raphael?
A Black man gave me the message.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
I hope you're comfortable.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
What is that?
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Yes.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Certainly, Ben.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
... I see.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Since you were a child?
Good morning, Mr. President.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
... Ben, really...
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
It's that gardener!
Good night.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Ben!
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Morning.
Which one is Elijah again?
Hi.
The iguana.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
And he was with her.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
I need a shower.
Maxine...
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
So how was it?
Mr. Juarez?
Security.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Dr. Lester. . .
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Dr. Lester...
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
Yes, well...
Hi.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Tickets to Malkovich?
You wanted to be partners with me?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Vegas? What'd you think?
The Great Mantini?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Yes, my dear?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
How do we do that?
Who's calling?
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Vegas.
There ain't.
Well?
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying nothing counts?
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
She gone like they say?
Well, if you want my opinion...
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Be here. In case.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Could be that fall you took.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
MAMA!
But mama..
The church!
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
Leave off..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
No, You looking good.
What, baby?
Hey!!
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Can we just rent it from you?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Where you going, Dude?
I was bowling--
I am the Walrus.
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
It's already posted.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
I've had a--
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Is that what that's a picture of?
Well--sure, I could do that--
A hundred.
Yeah, but what about--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Well...yeah--
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Jeffrey--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
So...that doctor.
What's your point, Walter?
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
So who--
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
Am I wrong!
Huh.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Walter!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
Walter--
That wasn't her toe.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Huh?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Walter, you fuck!
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
What's mine is mine.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
'Scuse me?
Fuckin' A.
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Who the hell is he?
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Recognize him?
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Each day is a little life.
You're hurting me.
What do you want me to do?
You came back for me.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
What's going on?
Nomak?
We're locked in.
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
What about you?  You're not coming?
You're too human, Blade.
Hold out your hands.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
But, he could've --
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
Just get out of here.
You care about him, don't you?
Any progress?
Get out of here --
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
That's weird --
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
But you use blood banks --
Blade --
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Try, please, Anna--
Not that I can see.
What're you doing there?
Inside the grave?
No!
--I'm not staying here!
Why are we here?
--how old?
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
Anna--
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I think we get the gist.
Just now?
What'd you dream?
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
I want to see something!
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
The witch?
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
No fucking.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
We should be so lucky.
Me, too.
What about night?
Where's Domini?
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Yeah. Me too.
Nobody's going anywhere--
Who?
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Let's get inside.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
What?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Women miscarry all the--
Dad...?
Are you alright?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
--I know!
What?
What the fuck's going on here?
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Abby. What's the matter?
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Well... the couch would be all right...
Ray?... What time is it?
...Ray?
...What?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...That's what's important.
...You leaving?
...So?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
So how long have you know Meurice?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
What's the matter?
...Just doin' my job.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
Dead, huh?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
...Count it if you want.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
That's not the point.
Is Marty here?
Got a problem, Meurice?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Who knows you have these?
Hello, daddy.
. MOMMY!.
Can I feel 'em?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Do you like that?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
. I. uh.
Yes.
Come in.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
Are you a bad boy?
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
I'll call you.
Shh. I'll tell you.
Who, Dorothy?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hey? . You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
I've gotta go in.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Are you alright?
So. what's next?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Yes. I do.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Yeah. but.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
Really?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Are you feeling okay?
How ya doin' Dad?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
What time are visiting hours?
I'm going out for awhile.
No.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
He comes over to study.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Greetings, Mr. George.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Que va hacer?
Blanca, por favor.
This is it for me.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Surprise.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Excuse me?
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
I don't know...
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
Goodness.
I don't think so.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
No?
What do you got there, Diego?
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
But you must.  It's the only way.
What's the matter, George?
George.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
Well, you know.  It's um...
Barbara.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Keep them coming.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I know.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Give this to Mom, will you?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Look what the cat dragged in.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
What do you want?
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
I don't know.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
What do you want from me?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I fucked up.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Are we good?
Nice weed, huh?
Smith.  Hampshire....
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ... Explain better ...
What "group"?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
How much are they paying you?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
But I haven't shot him.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
And how many are we?
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
Who is speaking?
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
Are you ready, colonel?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Take some time off.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Did they argue the day before he died?
Objection sustained.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Objection!
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Can I go?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Tell the court about that, please.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened next?
Why did she say she was leaving?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Did you suggest any?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Why does she come to you?
What did you prescribe for her?
Did he make your life miserable?
What happened?
Yes.
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Yes.
P.M.
Yes.
What do you have in your purse?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Are you going to represent me?
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
How?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
How'd you meet Marsh?
That's not an answer.
Nothing.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
You and me -- making love.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
Why would she lie?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Sugar or honey?
You don't need anybody.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Alright, I'll talk to her
I love you.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
I can back it up.
Really.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
What's wrong?
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
About a year and a half.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
And did you?
I'm sorry. That was...
My God. How I'd love to see that.
You drink bug repellent?
Smells like dirt.
When?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
You really don't need anyone?
But no one in particular.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Yeah?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Uh-huh. And?
Am I too heavy for you?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
What are you doing?
What do you want me to say?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
No. Don't do this.
What about your husband?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Franny?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Is it true?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Shit.
We can climb out.
That's what?
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
It's alright, baby.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Are they on the radio?
Cinn?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
What are we doing down here?
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
No way man...
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
You haven't?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
You gotta use your imagination.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You shouldn't have hit me.
Open the case!
Where is it?
The money!
We know how this was done, eh?
We're family, Caesar.
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
It couldn't have been.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
Tell them!  Tell them!
It's not here, Caesar.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Violet!
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
I guessed you were straight black.
Are they really?
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
A beer?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
...  I needed that.
No.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
What are you afraid of?
I don't.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
It's in a case, on his desk.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
What happened?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
What if he sees you?
I'm just asking, what if?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
Why?
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
Oh, thank God.
I was so afraid you ...
Hey.
Johnnie, what did I say?
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
And what if I couldn't do that?
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I won't ask again.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Treadstone.
I think so.
I don't know.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
Jesus...
I said ten thousand.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
-- you could put it together --
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Okay, so...
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- let me do this, okay? --
He's dead isn't he?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He came to kill us.
You knew he was coming.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
xxxxxx
You have ID?
Wait a minute --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
...ergency procedures.
... And then some.
You telephone, sir.
What have you got there?
Er ... Thanks ...
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thanks very much Sam.
If I can help you ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Sam!
Long time no see!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
You are late.
Layton! Oh shit!
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Enough though, eh?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
So what are you going to do about her?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
They weren't at school with us.
Yes we have, Jack!
You stupid bastard!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Are you alright?
Where are you taking me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Look at that - right on time.
They'll be there waiting.
Shit! The house is on fire!
What?
What happened to you after ...
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
Tuttle?
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Here. What do I do next?
That's it.
Can I forget it?
Sod it, it's broken!
Lime, I need to use your computer
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Whatever happened to you?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
This is an emergency!
Hello ... hello ...
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Er, don't you want to search me?
I don't know which numero.
Yes?
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
What the - ? How did you - ?
For God's sake, what's happened?
What is it?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
Es impossible.
No underwear?
Frank Pierce.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I guess I'll be going.
What about Kanita?
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Okay, what happened?
No. He's dead.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
You're not going to die.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Is he going to be alright?
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
He's dead, huh?
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
He's better.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He one of them?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
No.
I'm sorry.
The brakes are shot.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's get in a fight, then.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Don't push it, Larry.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
He's crazy.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
Keep it to yourself.
Shut up a second...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Wait.
No.  No.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Hold it down, okay?
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
Okay.
He excels at gratitude.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
I write for you sometimes.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Yes.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
Did you bring your grey suit?
No.
Do you feel good about it?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
The cost-efficient reporter.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Is everything all right?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
What?
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Go ahead.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Hi.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
I'll wait for you till seven.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
You okay?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
This is very awkward.
Are you okay?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Not even a little bit?
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
What's up, Walter?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Are you ready?
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Of course I do!
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Walter...stay away from me!
Here you go, enjoy.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
People seem to like my cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Go home.
You didn't mean to what?
A show..how soon can we go?
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
You're gonna shoot me!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
Well I'm overjoyed.
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
What's all the noise in here!
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
I look horrible.
Nice to feel needed.
Don't grab me, okay?
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
No, we didn't.
It's coffee.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Yes.
Wheels?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
He doesn't look fifty.
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
No, you didn't.  When?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Hey, Buffy...
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Who?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
He did what he was supposed to.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Like what?
What are we doing?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Time to do what?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Just stay away from me, okay?
Everybody does.
Wait a minute.
Where's the other one?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
What, um...  What do we do?
Why do you keep saying that?
Sporting events, yeah.
Here?
Who we gonna beat?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Same one.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
I'm curious, is all.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
Oh, God.
Smell of booze much.
Oh, thank you very much.
Except for Prom.
And the January Semi-formal --
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
No.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
We lost.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
It's Skip, for you.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
You should be at the game.
I don't dance.
She's dancing with me.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
He' s confused--
I doubt that.
It's possible.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
What happened?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
I got him on the knee!
Don't bump me.
I didn't spit on you!
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
I was great, eh?
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
What's wrong?
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
Don't try me.
Eight and twenty-four.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
What the hell's going on out there?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Look at yours.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
He even played golf with the President.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Okay.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
I'll call you right back.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Just say so.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
You lost your control.
All right.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Listen, I would -
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
...hundred yards further down the road.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Hello.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
It's always been our policy -
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
This woman's an institution.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
I'll be right back.
Any change?
...pit bosses, floor managers.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
Right?
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
What are you talkin' a- ?
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
It's under...
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Get off of me! Stop it!
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
You're lower than a dog!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
You threw it away?
Oscar wants you to call him.
With Jennifer.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Fuck you.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
Get - Get up! Get up!
Get - get up!
I wouldn't -
Don't you threaten me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Should I let her in like - ?
...and hypocrisy.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Yeah, okay.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Excuse me.
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
I just wanna get out of here.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
He won't let me in my own house!
Can I go in?
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Ace.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Hi, Jennifer.
Hi, how are you?
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
...same outfit.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Yes.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
There's more!
Yeah.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
You walk past me?
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Again!
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Yes, uh...
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Have we reached the epi-center?
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I better go report this in...
Selina, are you okay?
I've been looking for you.
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Pass!
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I loved you.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
You think so?...Selina?
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
Yeah, she's okay.
Did you try to kill...
Like you don't know...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
You're late.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Any place.
Was someone in an accident?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
What if they do question the authenticity?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
You switched license plates?
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
If you know that just back off.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Nels?
And what're you whispering for?
Who smashed the phone?
I don't want to know --
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
What makes you say that?
Who?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
Stop throwing names at me.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
What do you do for a living?
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
Both hands on your lap.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Five ... six.
They saw you kill the driver.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
I don't know what you mean.
You should've done all this before.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Negative.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Who's this?
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
We're gonna get there first.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Who were you talking to?
Seems not.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
The 405 is coming up.
What you think?
Saw that one.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
Good thing in a man.
Maybe he wants something.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Fuck off, Dave.
Don't be like that --
Sure, Dave --
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
That should make her happy.
Hi.
What was that?
What was that all about?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Jesus Christ!
Would you like a drink?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Maybe.
What does that mean?
You mean that?
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Do they know?
Details, baby, details.
Don't.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Happy now?
Don't.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
She from Scotland too?
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
You promise?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Come on...
So tell me.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
Good-bye, Dil
What?
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Not if you go.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
What was it?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Do you now.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
You a handyman, Fergie?
You sure?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
What?
Who is he?
Hope not.
Eat something, would you?
What do you mean you can't?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Hey --
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
What do you know about my nature?
No, what's the funny thing?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
She'd be anyone's type.
No?
She your wife?
You make a nice couple.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Can't.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Fergus?
Why?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
The best.
We don't look on it like that.
Is it bad?
You liked her?
Go to sleep now.
What?
When I was a child...
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
I said you bastard -- stop --
What?
The teddy bear?
What if I did?
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
No -- I guess not.
What's the matter?
When you come on, you really come on.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Of course there is!
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
That's the spirit.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Starting with his own.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
But you're -- divorced?
Oh.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
How long do you intend -- ?
Do I knock or something?
Keep going.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Does it hurt?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
I'm not fifteen.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
What are you doing?
Who told you to do that?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Yes, I know.
Got you.
What are you doing?
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Yes.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
I don't understand.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
What are you doing here?
We'll find you a hotel.
What was all that?
I don't think I follow you.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Peter -- are you all right?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
What is it about?
I don't see him.
Yeah?
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
is there anything you do?
You're grounded Friday night!
I'm not.
No!
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
What happened?
Well?
Hello?
She was murdered?
Can you get inside?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
I know where you're going.
Your brother told us.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Pay no attention to me.
You aren't going to the party?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Me? Why me?
_ Your father raped someone?
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
Someone tried to kill me.
You ok?
Especially not your dad.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
This place is empty.
You heard about that?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
I got to get home.
Why?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Are you coming to the party?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Go to the police station!
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Hi mom.
I need to ask you something.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
You ok?
What?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Where do you want this stuff?
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Huh?
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 

It happens to this piece of shit...

Okay!  All right!
    Elvis is on ice again.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
Come on, old...

Get over!  Get over!
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Come on...
What the fuck was that?!
Gee, you think so?
...ho!

All right.
Yeah...
You're--?  What?!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
...here!
Oh, no!


See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
It won't even start half the time.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
 Whoo!
Yeah.
A-And you  owe me...
We're gonna die!
Hey, hey, hey.
Arlo!  Arlo.
Okay. 
Okay, here we go.
...-natic.
Stop.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
Here...
And Brynner's right on...
Unbe-fucking-lievable.


...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.

Who put the big hurt on...
No.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Be cool.  Be--
What'd he say?
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

Vaughn.
Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...

Whoo-hoo! 
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
And I changed the schedule.

I beg your pardon?
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.

Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
Not tonight...

Yeah?

And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.

Gimme this god-...

 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
Do it now.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
How did she get that idea?
They're calling it an accident.
Oh yes.
None.
Too bad?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
What about her?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Avocado groves?
Is she all right?
Where is she?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
How do you do that?
How much are you worth?
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
In the garage.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
How do they do that?
Congratulations.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
I don't want it anymore.
No. It was an accident.
What are you doing here?
I want the rest of the pictures.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
I know what he says.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
You left your keys in the ignition.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Is there anything else you want to know?
I can't tell you.
Then it was over the water department.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
When was the last time?
Working for the District Attorney.
Hold still. Why?
...No. Why was it.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
The Albacore Club.
Do? To who?
It's possible.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
I can't...
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I said I want the truth.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
...where does Kyo live?
Sophie.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Yeah, Sophie.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
I said, the northwest valley.
Mr. Gittes?
Never?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
No, really?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
Of course not.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
They were partners.
So he says you sent them?
Yeah?
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
You weren't expecting me?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Father, I have sinned...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
How long's it been shut?
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Three cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
Yes, very!  Naturally.
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Was the show covered by every department?
And the notice?
I'm sure that's it. 
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
Emily!
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I intend to find out.
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
What's funny now?
Thanks.
A chicken?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Poor Mr. Carter!
Tired?
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
What?
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What check?
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yes and no.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
How did you meet him?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
Beats me.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Hey, now wait a sec...
Yeah, but not in here.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
You can hold me down.
So where is he?
God, isn't he great?
Why aren't there any lights?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
No.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You're serious. You want to date again.
You mean, on a date?
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
I'm serious.
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Then who operated the store?
Who are you to make assessments?
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
You're late.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
She called me.
Eight and a half.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Empire.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Don't yell at me, pal.
Pull my laces tighter.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Jesus.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Broke his neck.
Stop it.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
I could never reach.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
What?
I like to expand my horizons.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
What did she say?
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
You just fucked a total stranger?
Thirty-seven.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Lovely story.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You still didn't have to choke me.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Are you open?
Just the paper.
He's got those love handles.
You know him?
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
I am not.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
Oh... Can I help you?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
The porno mags?
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
How much money did you leave up there?
Ooh! Can we?!
How flattering.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Why do you call him that?
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
HOW MANY?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
I feel sick.
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
What is it?
You had to tell him.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
It stings a little.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
No way!
That doesn't sound metal.
Did he say "making fuck?"
He really wants to play metal?
Feel that.
I beg your pardon!
That's the price, my brother.
Dental School.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I will. Take it easy.
Answer the man.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
A monkey?
She's losing it!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
We'll never know, will we?
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Four...five...
Hello, Gabriel.
I know...
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Which could maybe what?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Gabe!?
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Nice view, huh?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Gabe are you alright?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
What's he doing?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
Murdering, motherfucker...
Travers, you're not running things.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Right.
What's the delay?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Is it set?
No names, this is an open line!
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Appreciate it.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
What did you do that for?
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Yes. They want to help.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Hullo.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
I beg your pardon?
Do you feel that way now?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Good.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Helping you, sir?
Surprise?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
I wanna be sick.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. What do you want?
You're keen on music?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Hullo, son, how are you?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
The ride is free.
Go ahead, say it.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
It's no big deal.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
You like being a lawyer?
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Annie...it's Max.
Max, the cab driver!
A deer?
You still carrying passengers?
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
You know Dmitri?
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
What?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
I never bought that.
It's nothing.
Hi, Ma.
I brought you flowers.
He'll keep calling.
...why is everything always about you...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
You prefer nights?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
You better?
Are you breathing?
Music.
Another collateral.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Gimme your wallet.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Who's Heller?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Slow the hell down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
They said send you downstairs.
That's love.
Look, I'm sorry --
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I better get going.
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
You okay?
If my universe had a hub...
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
He's why you punish yourself.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
Love at first sight?
How'd you get the picture?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Liza?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I'm a very patient man.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
You made your decision yet?
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
And you feel bad for it?
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
And you have no idea where he lives?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Ah, your psychotic is here.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What?
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
We've lost contact.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
What?
Got a bogey, boss?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
There is no direct evidence, no.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Talk to him.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
So who...?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
That isn't the way it works.
No more stalling, Captain.
Some kind of circuitry...?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
Ellie.  Arroway.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
I'm serious about this, Peter --
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
How do you mean?
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
Do you love your parents?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I read your book.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Ellie --
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
What...?
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
But --
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
No.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Go hard!
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
Please! Please!
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Here's the Patrol.
Here, Captain.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Somebody say somethin'?
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
I hate this...
Now look what you did.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
It's good medicine.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
You bastard!
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
I was?  How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
The door was already open...
What book?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Who?
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
How do you know that?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
We've got another one.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
What happened to you?!
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
Maybe you should...
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
The lock...
You know how to use this?
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Michael Johnson.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
How about I put Nikko on it?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
He's not treating her right...
We were together six years, sir!
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Not a lot of action here.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Where's the car?
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
It's about time.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Have you seen his penis?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Please finish your story.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
What does he want from you?
Crash victim?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I want to see my mother immediately.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
What's up with you?
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
How can I help?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
What do you think?
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Yes.
I'll see you soon.
Which flowers did you order?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm only looking out for you.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Chair, cup and ball.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
A while, I guess.
A small price.
No.
I wish I could have seen that.
What else would you do?
I have a terrible confession.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
I do.
Tell me all.
Where to?
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Not yet.
Good luck.
This must be Beast.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
I sure know what that feels like.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
So, another one bites the dust.
Can I put these here for tonight?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
Forget I asked.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Especially now.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
All tapped out.
Agent Hadley.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Hello?
Oui.
You've already robbed the safe?
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Why are you here?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
They're gonna be what?
Uh, no --
Why didn't you tell me about this?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Get that, will you?
Why is everything an argument with you?
Hopefully no one.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Do they come with batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
I will.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I've got a way with people.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
And the other car?
What hotel?
The map said to go left.
There has to be.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
This kind.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
You guys used to work together?
It's good.
How's my brother?
What happened?
Anybody know about that car outside?
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
How do we know what room she's in?
The money isn't here.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
And how do we do that?
When do we go?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Did she break your heart?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Can't sleep?
Sounds boring.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
What's this?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Go ahead.
And if I use them to kill you?
Tell me, who is your master?
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Put them down.
Do you know her?
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
I'll give them to you.
Where is he now?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Let's end this here.
Never!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Don't send me back!
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
No.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Don't you want to see her again.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
I don't know...
You buying?
No onions though, okay?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
My name.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
Don't interfere.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Top Dollar.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Get it?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
...necklace... pearls...
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
We've got company.
I've got him if you want him.
An unexpected pleasure.
I'm Kathryn.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Why not?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Romantic? He rapes her.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Thank you.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Need any company?
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
I don't.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
How am I a hypocrite?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
You don't know how to love.
But you knew this was important to me.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Outstanding.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
What do you mean?!
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
What are you doing?
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Just a kiss, right?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
My daughter, Rachel.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
She bought it.
One.
Pleased to meet you.
What's wrong?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
I don't find this very funny,
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
What are the terms?
Call me later.
Moving along quite well.
Who are you calling?
Exactly the opposite.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
I'm not in the mood.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Ronald?
Well done.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Well please leave a message that I called.
She's out.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
Did you ever make a wish?
The Farren house
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
She was very pretty.
I know that.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Where is everybody?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
Amy, not that old tree!
What do you want. Amy?
And who did the voice belong to?
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But where do you come from?
I shall want you for always.
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Oh, how beautiful!
You?
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
But I only came to give back the ring.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
The Headless Horseman --
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Mother! You called me by name!
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
Can't you get contacts?
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
No, did you fuck him?
At least your PMS is over.
I wonder if he's married.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
So where's this infamous arm now?
I've been here. What day is it?
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
I'm cleaning my stove.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
About Benito.
I thought you and George were getting married.
Hello?
Oh come on. Knock it off.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Like what?
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
I really gotta get going.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Everything okay?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
What's with the squirt guns?
Your breasts feel larger.
How do you know?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Here's a towel.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
What are you talking about?
How long have you been here?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
They don't speak English...
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
How can I submit this?
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Who is it?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
People...  after me.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Such a joker!  Like your father.
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Someoneís after me.
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
You've been working too hard.
What happened to you?
They barely talk anymore.
What's with her?
For a month.
Dave...
Till what?
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
A condition...
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Check his kids.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
What are you gonna do?
What I told him to?
What do you mean by that?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
No.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Thanks, I wrote it.
President vetoes works bill?
This is wrong, Alan!
Now he's making stuff up about me.
And it's proving quite effective...
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
How'd you get started?
Your government needs your help.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
You ever use it?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
I was waiting for that jack.
Who?
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Oh... Yeah.
That was quite a thing you did today.
What?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
That's a secret.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
What's wrong?
Hi.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
So this is it?
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Tonight?
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
What is it?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
What?
NOOOOOOOOO!
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
They're townies?!
It will?  How do you figure?
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
I here and now commit myself to daring!
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
I think he's sweet.
You know what really excites me about you?
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Who else was involved in this?
Hey, he's your roommate.
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
You fucked up little prick!
That's your sister school, right?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Chris!
But I love you.
Yes sir.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
Father!
Weird.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
What is it then?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
I've found it.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Visit from my father.
You the Captain?
It's not going to help us!
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Where are my men?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
I don't know where it is!
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
What's the matter?
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey...it's okay...
It's okay...come on...
Man, don't go up there...
She's gone...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Or maybe not.
I mean...where is everbody?
Why don't you back off?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Check it out!
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Who's going?
Here's to huntin'.
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Tell him, Vince!
Let's go!!!
That's new, isn't it?
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
I have to go.
No. None of that.
You are his friend.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
How was huntin'?
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Hey, Nick...
No?
Not so good.
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Linda...
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Nick?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
Pow?
What are you, hoping?
I thought you might be praying.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
We gotta play with more bullets.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Great. That's great.
See you Monday.
What's that noise?
Great. Hey. That's great.
Did you get one?
Yeah.
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Funny guy.
Give it to me.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Sir, your transmission's fading.
Sir---
Need help?
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
I have to go home, Sanchez.
They're going to rob that bank.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
You need anything else?
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Rip Van Winkle.
You treat her nice.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
You should be in hospital.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
I'll take it.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
You know that you're in my house.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Mama!
But I like the new one better.
Howdy, Jabez.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Say ... about the interest ...
Stevens!
Where's everybody?
Now run along, Daniel.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Yes, why shouldn't it?
No, no! Give it to me!
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
What -- what's on your mind?
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
But -- I was just lucky.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
I think his leg is broken.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
You'll never change -- will you?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
But Jabez, I never said that!
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Do you really think that?
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
My son ... what's the matter?
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
It is.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Me?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
I can't be honest with them.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Hans, he killed by brother --
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
The code key, please...?
Bad for your health anyway.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
New York...
Three down, four to go --
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Encourage them to be bolder.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
'Roy'.
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Roy?  You still with us?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Aw, hey...
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
What am I supposed to do?
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
I don't have a choice.
They won't talk to you.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
You alone, or you got confederates?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Okay, give us the women.
The girl hostages.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
I want to talk to him.
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
We're all set at Kennedy.
What's the matter with you?
Howard, give him the keys...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
Do you think we can turn it on?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You like me?
Are you a lawyer?
Thanks again, Sam.
Did you always call him Junior.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
You shouldn't start now.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
He's gone?
You mean that?
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
Sonny -
I never been up in a plane before.
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Hey, let's get ready!
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
Robbing a bank.
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
And if you can't deliver them?
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Yes.
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.

I don't like anything else.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Don't come back, either.
You the man.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
Make it plain.
How long?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Good morning.
Mookie.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Jade.
Nice!
Jade, you're late.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
It's a fucking shame.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Can you pay me now?
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Do we now?
Mookie?
Before I get off work.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Hot.  Hot.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
How long then?
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Why you gotta curse?
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Smack him back.

You really think so?
Pino, relax, will ya.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
I didn't think so.
Pop, stop lying.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Oh my god, are you alright?
But I came here to learn about America.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Excuse me.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
O'clock?
Would you like something to drink?
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
HARRY? Are you okay?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
No no no no no.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
H A R R Y...
One day they'll find a cure.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Just a guy I hang out with.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
You take that back!
Collins is a great man!
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
You're it.
These are really cold, huh?
Owww... refreshing.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
That's a cow, Harry.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
Sure I do. On one condition.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
A raft.
George Washington!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
You certainly did.
But my mom gave me the map.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Ready Lloyd?
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
You take her.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
What?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
You really are a pirate.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
I'm not sure if I can do this.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
God, I've missed you.
Times two.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
And, take some more pictures.
Everything?
The evidence of what?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
My Lord!
My thanks.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes, Sire.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Things have been so serious here lately.

Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
No.  I don't work here.
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Are you sure this is okay?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Bela, what happened?!
You'll be sitting on the right.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why are you here??
What happened?!
I've never seen anything like him!
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Edward Wood, Sir.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
It's a damn good role.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
My eyes are killink me.
Can I help you?
Is there a script?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Isn't he dead?
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Hello.
What are you making?
Did you find it boring?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Stop!
What was that?
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Those assholes.
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Huh?!
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
I'm really sorry...
You're sure this is gonna work?
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
What do you love her or something?
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
You thought it was me?
Oh, Al ... This is just...
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
You think she really likes him?
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Yeah?!
Great line.
Ed, do you want my advice?
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
So he killed himself.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
Who?
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Oh my god! On TV!
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
She won't.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
What are you doing?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Yeah...
Cream rinse?
Oh my God.
Leave. Go.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
I wish my stepfather was here.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
Shari, I really like you...
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
It's not their fault.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
All right.
Polish acrobat.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Marcia's living with a singer?
Hi.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Why me?
... Ray?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Look, we gotta talk.
You know what your problem is?
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
No -- keep it.
Hello.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
Hi.
Oh!!
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
How?
By the X.
Yo --
El/ella -
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
what?
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Having a problem with your eye there?
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
Larry?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Why are you doing this?
What a surprise.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
What is it. Tammy?
Could you get this? I can't
Shall we give it a name?
And she's super-nice
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
People can see this.
I mean at you.
Thought what?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You dumbshit!
Merry Christmas.
That obvious, huh?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
How'd she meet Patchett?
But you did it anyway.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
Did you talk to Exley?
In the morning.
They're yours.  Take them.
Maybe.  I don't know.
That's him.  That's him.
Was it... a rat?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Dudley.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
What do you want to know?
What do you mean?
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
And?
You're wrong.
Dudley, we've been over this.
I... No.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Yes, I do, sir.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Damnit...
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
What's that for?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
What's on the call sheet?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
You sound like you mean it.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
Where will you go?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Around.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Really?  How?
What'd he give to you?
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You knew the deal. No contact.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
I mean did you call anyone.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Fuckin-A.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
Goddammit--
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
How?
Reynolds.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
Feeling lucky?
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
Do you see anything you like?
Because my life is being ruined.
Your stuff?
A police report.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Anything at all?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
For your wife?
Bobby!
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
It's not true.
You <u>swore</u>!
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I know.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Does that hurt?
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
Who?
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
What can I do for you?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
You don't know who the fuck--
How's the trout?
It is fish.
DePinto?
Brill?
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
How can I be sure.
Thank you.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
You being audited?
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I can't.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
He didn't.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
Hey!
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Some of 'em.
Yeah.
How long can you stay?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
My stuff's all over her apartment.
You gotta--
No, I--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
I'm sorry, man.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah.
What does that have to do with you?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
Then what's your goddam opinion?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
What about the tapes?
Am I to understand--
No sir.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Now is that clear?
Thank you.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
You should come into the shelter.
Do they know them?
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Dance with me.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Why did you hate me?
Don't leave me!
What kind of photographs?
Very well.
Have you seen Katharine?
It's Geoffrey under this.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
What did you do?
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Why do they care about our maps?
I believe I'm rather late.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
David Caravaggio.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
No.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Well, then ask him his name!
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Top Hat.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
He's Canadian.
Excuse me -
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
That's a different dress.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
So I follow the wires?
Why would anyone do this?
What are you up to?
This is hot!
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
Why Picton?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
I'll come with you.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
Kip?
The windows don't open.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
Don't overestimate yourself.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
I have a question...
You have a car?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
I've got something...
And I thought we were getting on so well.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
But Roki said--
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
It's a fake.
It's one way.
Those are my clothes.
And--
And good morning.
I know it well.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Let's do it again.
I trust it's your size.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
He wasn't.
Camera in the--
One, two, three...
Careful...careful.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
Peoples China Bank.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
You shouldn't have.
So what are you going to do with your share?
The door's the only way out!
What's wrong.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
He looks familiar.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Gin, really.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
You'll just have to have faith.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
What the hell is this doing here?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
The judge came up with a number.
I don't even know how much money that is.
And get someone to help around the house.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Yeah?
Out to lunch with the girls.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
What medical records?
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
What do you mean?
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
Why good?
She insulted me!
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Fuck Kurt.
When'd they file the demur?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Ross.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Yeah.  A real moron.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
Great.
You're not nothing, Erin.
You are someone.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
About this.
Thank you.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Think you could learn?
I'm embarrassed.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Where's my paycheck?
What?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
What?
You're moving away?  When?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
He can do it.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
... Luke, you must not go.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Barks his consternation.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Yes sir!
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Sir, I was wondering ...
Yes, Your Highness?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
You don't look angry.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
What are you afraid of?
There's something out there!
Are you crazy!
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Probe?  What probe?
About what?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Get out of here, Lando!
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
I'll take what's mine now.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
It's a lovely outpost.
What's going on?
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
We've got to find Luke.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Where are you going?
Leia!
I have followed my feelings.
I can't. It's too big.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Yes, My Lord.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
It won't get through the blockade.
Do you have a name?
Nobody's going to believe it.
What are they doing here?
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Who's that?
I tried...
Give it to me.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Plissken...?
Getting ready to invade.
Location.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Me too?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
How do we get out of here?
Where's the anti-toxin...?
All of us?
Is he coming?
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
At last...
Whose son am I?
I want to thank you.
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Yes.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
You are truly magnificent!
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
I'm sorry.
Hi
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
Where do you want this?
Groceries maybe? A package?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Oh, she'd love it.
Thank you.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
How are you today?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
She used those words?
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
About my daughter?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
On what?
I didn't get you?
Oh yeah, since when?
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
No, is Regan aware of it?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Oh look at that.
Where?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain who?
Oh I bet he is.
Yeah
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Hi Chris. Great party.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Shut up!!
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Who?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
I'm afraid.
It's my goddamn car!
Yeah, come on in.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
So?
Well, look at this.
Honey ...
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
When they coming in?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Jack.
Don't make trouble, all right?
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
So we on tomorrow night?
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Seeing anyone in particular?
This time you gotta go.
You gotta go.
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
What're you talking about?
Nice, huh?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
A gust of wind killed him.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
I'm not unhappy.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Awe inspiring.
Get out of here.
No.
Just a lucky guess.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Unless you want the right.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
What the hell are you doing?
Really.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
Couple years.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
We're not getting paid then.
What's it for?
What channels it on?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
Stay off it.
You weren't there.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Actually, that's my stage name.
This is show business?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
A seven.
Save it for your wife.
Nine!
Shoes?
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You two could play checkers.
He's right.
I don't believe it.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Peggy Lee?
What's with you two?
Got another song for us?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Huh?
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
How come?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
Is that the way it is?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Where's egghead?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
I can keep the beat.
Nina?
The both of them?  In there?
He had a mind that escalated things.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Ivory.
From Hurley's?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Hey, bro ...
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
What do you mean?
Go on.
Which ear was it?
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
-- Castor?
You'll what?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
What are you -- stupid?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Commander, what are you doing here?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
I'm just having some fun.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
-- what?
... That's great.
Where's Jamie?
Kate Reynolds...
Her assistant?
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Take you, for instance...
No.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Do you like kids?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
She is relentless.
She said that?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
Got a minute, Jack?
C’mon Jack...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
Evelyn, right?
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny?
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Don’t  go, Jack...
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Hello!
Uh...that baby’s crying...
Look, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I was such a saint before and I’m such a prick now.  Maybe I’m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
You mean this chocolate cake?
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
Jack...can we afford all this?
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I need to tell you something.
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
It’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
I'm sorry...
Mrs. Peterson.
No...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
I want to see you again.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Those yours too?
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben --
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
About me?  How sweet.
What do you want, Vic?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
You're on fire!
Stop it.
I'm driving.
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Front page?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
I, uh, think I remember the number.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Feeling better?
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
It's just business.
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Okay to proceed.
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
What're you getting at?
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Right, sir.
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Thank you for saving my life.
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
What can we do?
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
It's against my better Judgment...
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
You said there was a quick way out!
There it is!
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
Sabotage? I don't understand...
You have no right to blame Duval --
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
I don't believe that.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
May I?
What happened?
What is it, Skipper?
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
Unguent.
One of us pays the other for half.
Huh?
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
How ya doin'?
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
...Yah, okay...
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
but do you know that for sure without -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Well... yah.
...Dad?
Yah, pretty good.
I mean a parking lot.
Yah.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
We're good to loan in.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
...Geez.
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Linda Cooksey?
Oh. Geez.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Hon?
Not on your feet too much?
They announced it?
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
The first rule of Project --
What... ?
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
You need to lighten up.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I want brain parasites.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
I found a new one.
It's for men.
Look, this is a bad time...
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
It's time for you to leave.
There?
You feel nothing?
You... don't have to... leave.
You hear that?
What is this?  Who did this?
What did you say... ?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Who did this to you?
You were in here last Thursday night.
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
It's getting exciting now.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Thank you.
What?
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
A nice, big cock.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
What?
Alive or dead?
Okay... Ghandi.
You're sure?
What?
Promise you won't.
Promise?
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
I asked you what you studied.
This conversation...
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Ask me nicely.
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
What are you doing?
Look at me...
Excuse me?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
His name is Robert Paulson!
Really?
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Biology, mostly.
What list?
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
No!  It can't be.
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
Want me to drive?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
I mean it.  Take care of it.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
Is that something you're "feeling?"
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Police are coming.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
Knock it off!
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Again.
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
You read me, Brewer?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's she saying?
How you doing, Brewer?
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You better take off.
Gawd, you look awful.
How do we get upriver?
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Invulnerable.
I know.  I go with you.
What's the job?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Typical...
How long before you're fully on line?
Who're you?
Hello, John.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Let's do it.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
I... You're not going to understand this.
Hello....congratulations.
What do you think?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
What?
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Hello Lydia?
Yes.
Which ones?
Your name was picked.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
Oh, Lydia!
<u>What</u>?!
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
Him...?
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Are there any questions?
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Happily married, probably.
In a bar called Hellfire.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Well, id'n that nice.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Cerveza.
Now, now.
I'm going on over there...
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
What?
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Sure...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Just finish eating.
Come on.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I don't make the rules.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Tea.
I just can't look at you.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
It's not that bad.
What questions?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Where is she, anyway?
But what about me?
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
You had no inner feeling?
No, it isn't what I think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
No, don't do that...
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I have to talk to you.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
Oh, for chrissakes...
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
No, I wouldn't.
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Mass production is what does it.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Pardon me?
Miss Dupea.
If you want to call it that.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
So watcha doin'?
What are you doin' here?
That's it?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Who gives!
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Like this?
You sure?
You live around here?
Fletch!
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Ask anybody.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
No idea at all?
For sure?
My pleasure.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Oh my God!
Here you are, Doctor.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Ten days ago?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
John Ultramalensky, right?
They busted me last week.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Why don't you try suicide?
So why pick me?
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
Do you have a passport?
'Magic' today, huh?
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
John who?
Damn, I thought I had that one.
Why do you keep doing this?
Alan's in Utah.
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Are you still in love with Alan?
Why'd you let me in?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
I was afraid you'd say that.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
I would, actually.
Your call is come through.
The door was unlocked.
Fletch.
Two...
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I never read the paper.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
Who?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Gummy and two cops...
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I have some ideas.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Who's Frieda?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
That was close...
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
So what about this watch?
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
You going to be okay?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
What an interface!
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Spunk, come back...
Zuzu, wake up...
Are you okay?
My axe!
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Ouch.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I'm sorry...
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
What's fine?
How's it going?
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Well, hello, Ford.
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I'm still the king!
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
What's my name?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Le sommes nous?
There'll be someone else.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Where's he from?
That's in France.
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
Who is that guy?
No, you?
The greaser with the blonde.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Popeye.
Why not?
What happened to you?
Same car.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
You're shitting me!
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
It looks open on the other side.
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
Frank...what's wrong?
You give him his drops?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
About what?
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
What?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
What'd you say your name was?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
You just burned the desk.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
What's that?
What are you talking about?
What?
What?  What is it?
What are you talking about?
I'll warn them.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
I'll be damned.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Got it.
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
Huh?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Got a minute?
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Are you a good cop, John?
What is that?
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
What was that?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
It's dark down there.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
Why did you come back here?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Please... be cool.
Got any good ideas?
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
You don't "have to."
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Ahh, nothing.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Why?
So what happened?
You mean you had a bad dream.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Where'd you get this?
But what if they try and scare us?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Which is?
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Look, I don't want your money!
What do you want?
Steven buggin' you?
What's the problem here?
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Get up!
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
That's very colorful, chief.
Why did you want her body?
Tell me.
She's beautiful.
Why didn't you tell me?
Does he know about what happened?
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, c'mon!
Wanna know how I did that?
Are you crazy?!
Don't do anything stupid.
I've told you the truth.
I didn't kill her!
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
But she might be in trouble...
A major prick.
No thanks.
What are you going to do?
Time to check out the waiters.
What's wrong?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Where did you get that alcohol?
Did you find Rennie?
I...I can't...
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You had me worried to death!
Can't we at least talk about it?
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Everything okay?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
So, are you having fun yet?
I didn't mean for you to go!
You have to call the police...
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
You say we go?
I'm not ready.
We're making too much of this.
Shoot him.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
Let's work on it.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
What?
Because we're completely mismatched.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Is it?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Opening night?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
What else?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Opening night, Lillian.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
Life is good.
What do you want?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
We must have been heroic.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
You're charming the boy.
It's a complicated subject.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
This could be it!
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
They're my team.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
Have to hurry back.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Yes.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Yes.
You've worked with Elliot?
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
So do I. Over and over.
He wears a disguise.
What? Come on, Paisley.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
I am your wife.
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
What do you expect when you talk like that?
That was lucky.
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
What'd he say?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
And Jinnah?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Are you going to walk all the way?
You mean a general strike?
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
We need your help!
In England, I was a poor student but I --
The fools!  Sorry...
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Assuming we are in agreement?
All right. Fine.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
You almost sound like you believe that.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
How much extra?
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
From what budget?
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
It's not too late to back out.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
It's all right.
Come on--we're taking off.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
Where are you taking her?
Hello?
How the hell did you get here.
Why have you done this?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Not that.
Hugo!  I've found him!
It was a mercy-killing after all.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
--when you go away.
What about them?
I'll take care of my end.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
You okay?
It doesn't look like that.
What's Beynon got set up?
Half a million.
Boring.
That's not all of it.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Promise you won't laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
I'll bet you can.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You can't trust anything these days.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We're going to make it.
We got this far.
No more about Beynon.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Okay.
Come on, come on.
How long before this car's hot?
What now?
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Hope you get to where you're going.
Suit yourself.
Two.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
What do you have in mind?
How's Mama and the kids?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
How was that?
Let's just get to the border.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
What's the damage?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Yes.
What did you do?  Albert?
You knew what I'd do.
What do you want?
What's it got to do with you?
Oh ay?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
She's nothing to do with me.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Sid Fletcher.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
He was here for four days.
Who's setting you up in this place?
What kind of entertaining?
Who set it up?  Eric?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
How's school?
Where you going to live, then?
I mean, what for?
What you having, Jack?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
It's not like that, luv.
Ta.
What is it?
You don't look it.
Do you want breakfast?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Scotch, please.
Nasty way to go.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
Three hundred altogether?
I'll see you, then.
Polacks and deadbeats.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
It's too...
You're on this...
It's not.
No.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
Starting up.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Somebody...
What could somebody get for them?
No.
You didn't?
A buck a shot.
He'd give me a job.
You...
Yes.
Dave.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
They're going to come to everyone.
...you don't have to come in...
Why?
You need money?  Is that the...
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.
I am?
Why don't you think so?
Where were you?
Will you excuse...
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
Shelly: get in the office.
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Excuse me, fella.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
You have a problem?
The people downtown said...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
...you talk to Murray...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
What are we going to say?
Now?  Now?
Why?
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Yes.  I hear you.
No.  It hadn't.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Don't.
John: John:...my daughter...
Just now.
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
"Always be closing..."
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
Glad to meet you.
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
You're sure?
Rick...?
Yeah.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
And when was that check cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
Fuckin' asshole.
Guess what the Machine did?
You just this morning...
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Yes.
Are you alright?
On your pillow.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
What position did you occupy?
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
What took so long?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Then why do you come to me?
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Would you like some?
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Ready, Frankie.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
That's off now.
He's not the same as when I met him.
Where's my wife?
Hello?
Mikey, I hoped...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
What was it, so I'll know.
Where's my brother?
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
They are everywhere!
It might show.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Kay.
How's the baby?
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
I had no idea...
Kay, I told you...
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
This doubles my investment.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
I know.
Says who?
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I know.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Are we going to eat or what?
He supports me.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
So what did you think?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
I'm not married.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You ever been married, Hanna?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You did not know?
Good morning.
And your name is --?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
These are your paintings?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
So we understand each other?
Sorry.  Not today.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Very well put.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
Who's that?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
That only leaves the rest.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Storm's getting worse.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Need some help?
I can undress myself, thank you.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Where's Betty?
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
You're serious.
Can that count as one question?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
How's the leg?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
I'm not interested --
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You want to come along quiet?
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Got it ...
You ever feel bad about any of this?
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Forget that ...
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
How are we supposed to--
What are you doing back?
Have you seen him?
He's in some trouble ...
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Hey, Kip ...
Kip -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
Nah. It's a scratch.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
He's gonna kill you -- !
You don't think so, huh?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
You hear me?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
What era was that -- ?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
I've missed you, man ...
Toby...
Where'd you find this one?
Where you off to -- ?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Now what -- ?
Call 911 -
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
So I was replaced by Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
And here I am...
What kind of trouble -- ?
Hey.
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
She's trouble --
I go with you --
You mentioned that in your letters
Ready -- ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
So, you seeing anybody?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Now... I'm in ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
You okay -- ?
This time it's for real?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
You need him...
Okay, then... Otto?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
What happened to Sway?
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
What about me?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Anybody!  You understand?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
What're you doing? What about the car?
What do you do?
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
Paulie's gonna make him?
What'll I tell Fran?
Watch this.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
What happened to you?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Where'd you find such creeps?
I gotta go home.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Are you okay? What happened?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Who'd you call?
How's the woman?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
You're kiddin' me.
Hi.
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
--That isn't funny--
Yah, that is a nice ass.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Some other guy?
Holy shit.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
What are you smiling at?
I can come back.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Yes.
Sean.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Would you excuse us?
You moved?
Seems like it's going well.
He married his cousin.
--And confuse him--
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
He won't be a failure!
Who is he?
What should I do?
I could go for a Whopper.
Well, she out did herself today...
What?
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Probably not.
That must have taken you a long time.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
What does?
What is?
Yeah? You got a lady now?
My wife's dead.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
When did you know she was the one?
What did you think?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
What?
Yes.
The wrench, why?
Don't fuck with me.
See ya.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Yeah?
No I wasn't...
You grew up around here?
I bet you have a great family.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
I've never seen your place.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Want me to take a look?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I know. I just do.
I don't know. I just feel it.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Yes, I do, Will.
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Kinda pie y'got?
Want to work?
How many men?
Can all of you work?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
No, I never. What?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
She's settlin'.
Think she'll hold?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Get to what?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
What's the matter, Grampa?
How 'bout Granma?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Anybody ask anything?
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Pa! Shh!
That!
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
How about it, Ma?
When?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
Here we go!
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
--Stop it--
Bob. Bob Destephano.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Bob...
It's me. Martin Blank.
What am I gonna do?
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
Tell me about yourself.
Are you going to the reunion?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Yes.
Hello...?
Flowers. That's funny.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Not the other way around...?
...About five years now.
You kill people. 
You went to school with these people.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
How was your day, today, sir?
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
What do you want?
Thank you, no.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
Enough?
You have a headache?
Of course you will.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
He sells BMW's?
It didn't work out.
Why not?
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
You okay?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Yeah.
How did you meet her?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Everything under control?
Just make yourself comfortable.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Show me again.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Oh, honey... What happened?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
What?
How long is this going to go on?
I don't believe this!
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Nothing.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
When? Tonight?
Who's going to want me now?
Who is it?
Great!
David?
Yes. We're suing.
I should go get some of her things.
Aw... that's so sweet.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
You've already made arrangements!?
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I miss you, Annie.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Yes?
No. I am a "tubab."
Was the trip okay?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Of course not.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
What does she do?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Can you drive?
I can't...
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
I can't... not yet...
You shut up, stupid!
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Cool?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Very impressive.
Hold on a second!
Ta-da!
One-handed!
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Did you talk to him?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
What are you doing?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Up all night again, huh?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
How was school?
Shit! Come on!
Yo, showtime, showtime!
What the hell is going on?
He's not in this class.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
What?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
There they are!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Excuse me.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Gill.
There's a new virus in the database.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
A hacker planted the virus.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Send a Flu-shot.
Just one moment.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Who's that?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Brady!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
Found it.
Honey, I don't think their home.
Because the lights are all out.
We should call the fire department.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Four plus Myers.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Sure it does.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Jamie, what happened?
What?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Jamie, wait for me.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
We'll hear sirens soon.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
Its true, Sheriff.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's the radio?
Sort of.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
What time?
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Get him out of here!
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
I wonder where they went.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Anybody live here?
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Sure...
They could be.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
TOTALLY!
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Hey, Laurie...
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
What about the rest of my comic books?
Right.
Yes, she is.
She's washing her clothes.
There's nothing else I can do.
PROBABLY going.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
Oh, yeah.
That's just --
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Uh...
What?
And you, you-you're going?
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
How ya doin', man?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Hi.
Yes.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Elliot!  Don't!
Elliot!
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I thought you weren't coming.
Lee... uh...
Are you in a bad mood?
Why not?
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Oh, Mom!
What's the problem?
Why?
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
It was on your shirt!
No.
I'm okay.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
Hey!
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Okay.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Oh, Hannah!
He's married...
You found all this, all this out on one date?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Boy--
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
What's the matter?
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
I'd never do that.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
No, I am.  I am.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
You're okay, though, huh?
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
It's all right.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi.  How you doin'?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
...you...
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Who would that be.
Evelda Drumgo.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
How you doin?
What's new onna street?
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
..It won't be long now, sir...
What reaction?
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
..suitcase...locker...
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
I'm an orphan.
Waal...
Waited too long, hon...?  
I said how's your baby...?
Give it up.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You know America?
Darling...
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Make them eat the figurine.
Thank you, Cordell.
...which of us is free...?
You should get Married.
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I am on the track of...
I know where he is.
Thank you.
...what a lovely perfume.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Yes.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
You want some <u>advice</u>.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
My encounter.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
Man, she's losing it...
Mine!
Goodnight, Jasper.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody.

"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Fuck off.
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Sorry Veronica.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Gee, thanks.
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
I was talking with someone!
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
You stupid cunt!
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
What are you doing?
No way, no day!
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Probably....
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
Perrier water!
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
You going to eat this?
We on tonight man?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
You two....
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
Come on, sit up.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
What does old Stew want?
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Look, Mother!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
looks startled at the outburst.
I think I'm dying . . .
Him.
That.
I think I'm going crazy.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Pitbull attacks.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
Sure plenty of times.
Since what?
Hello I'm Dr...
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Who's Allison?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
What do you want?!
Do you know where you are?
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
You got a drinking problem or what?
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
He gives a good report and I walk?
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
You!
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Here.  Get off here.
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
What's the matter?
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
That too.
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
She wants to quit?
It's not unthinkable.
He lost a shoe!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Where are these toys of yours?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
-- hospital.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
Right.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Do you do washing machines, too?
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Thank God.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
How were we -- were we cool?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Do you remember who gave us this?
How long does it have to be a new house?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
His secretary just confirmed.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
I think it's time I came home now.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Let's follow 'em.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Lieutenant?
Tough.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
Where were you last night around nine?
You sure?
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
Must you do that?
Sing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
I'm leaving.
Maybe myself.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
To ask her to dance.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
Well?
It will be a good harvest this year.
Agreed.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Sometimes.
Leaving?  For how long?
Do you love me, Conner?
Why are you doing this?
Yes.  How did you know?
You're hurt.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
That makes you uncomfortable?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Why not?
On the back it has--
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Where will you go now?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
You stayed here again last night?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
How can that be?
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
You get anything on Smith?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Jesus.  What is this?
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
Not if they're looking at something else.
You with the cops?
I'll give you these people.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Who else is here?
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
What the fuck is that?
You got something to say?
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
Can you identify this man?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Are you out of your mind?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
Ow!  Shit!
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Now we can do whatever we want.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
I can't go without Thomas.
Are civilians inside?
That's enough.
Louise?
Chief, base.
Do it.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What are you people going to do?
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
Where are you right now?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
Can you open them?
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Please, I don't use guns.
How much?
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Paul, you know who this is?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
Satellites.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
I will see what I can do.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
Your police are at the gate?
What do you mean, General?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You will tell them the truth.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
There are no more rooms.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
The commander is not here.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Has Roger spoken yet?
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
Go to the roof now.
I have a confession. When we met...
Let me go. Children get off.
Rutaganda's place?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
Where has all our beer gone?
What is this about no water?
Paul. Are you alright?
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
There must be some other way out.
What?
Excuse me?
-- I did: down here.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett!
This is nuts.
I'll meet you down there.
-- closed.
Is she...alright?
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
You hear somebody?
Good point.
What --
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Don't touch me!
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
Steven --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You think this is fucking funny??
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
I was upstairs!
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
Rewind that.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Don't know that it does.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Ghosts killed your father?
And you think it's in there?
-- hey! --
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
We don't have proof of that.
They don't build them like this anymore.
Are you all right?
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
Don't play games with me, little girl.
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
I can't move!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
What is it?
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
You're bleeding.
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
We'll never know for sure.
How long will it take!
What's going to happen?
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
What will he do?  What does he want?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
Wha .... ?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Uh-huh?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
What?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
How have you ... ?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Sure.  Why?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
What am I looking for?
Joey ... ?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Welcome. 38
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Yes really.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
But you gave me a rose ...
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
How do we start?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Hmmmm.....
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
You got about five minutes and change.
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Alex, are you....
My life is not some deal.  I...
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
What the hell....
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Wha--
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Where did you get this?
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
I hope you know what....
Good job, not pretty, but good.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Thanks for sharing.
Snappy.
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
Ol' satchel-butt...
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Cigarette?
You're from Muncie?!
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Well, I --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Oh, is that it!
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Oh, Norville --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Just got hired today!
How long've you been down here?
My pleasure, sir.
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Yessir.
Sir?
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
...education, were you?
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Ya don't say.
How's that, Sid?
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
She's got other problems, of course...
...adenoids.
She isn't!
At the Houmfort.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Mrs. Rand.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Does she suffer?
You're single?
But it's so far away...
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
No, Wes.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
A mental case?
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You wanted to warn me...
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
You want that?
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
What about her?
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Benjie!
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
I... I think I am...
You crying?
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
The turkey in?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
If you're going to insult me --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Hi dad.
About?
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Here.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Good-night dad.
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
Good shit.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
I saw you on your bike today.
Who?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I suppose. Why?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Oh.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Here you are.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Now you are being rude.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
No candy for me?
Truly? Do speak.
Where you going?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Wow!
When worlds collide.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Is this Charles?
All my model planes.
Want a drink?
I love you.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Good.
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Duggar called him?
What about your shoulder?
Thanks.
No.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
No.
That's right.
You know my plan of action.
He's asking everybody questions.
Fred Duggar?
Will.
I don't know.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Hey...
No...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
My arm!
I suppose.
What about him?
Where's your back-up?
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
What are we?
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
Are these not the answers you came for?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Why does he call you that?
Claudia! You did that?
You want me to be a doll forever?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
You both did it?
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
The ship is sailing wihout us!
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
He can protect us, Claudia.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
Diane!!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Did I hear a yes?
You're sure?
Have you ever been caught?
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
As did the one who made me.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Where are we?
We belong in hell.
Unless I make her one of us...
She's here, your wounded one.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
And they frighten you?
You followed me here, didn't you?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
You found nothing?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Your what?
I want off this island.
Stupid. Stupid.
Get lost, you scared me.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Say yes.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
He does work hard.
Hello? Hello?
No way.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Ray, I can't...
I understand something.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Ray...what are you doing?
Julie! Wait! You okay?
The shower again?
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
There was a body! I swear it!
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Oooh, the mainland --
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
You think that's a good place to hide?
What's going on?
Where is everybody?
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
Goodbye.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
You are fortunate in your father.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
Theodosia.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
You know that sound, Oliver?
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
I have had command for the last time —-
Daughter -- my daughter --
Thea, what's wrong?
Well, tell, him.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
You have no car.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Clarence . . .
I . . .
She's . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
You sent for me, sir?
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Hey, Ernie!
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
It will?
Hee-haw!
What's that?
Uh-huh.
Hmmmm . . .
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
No, George, don't . . .
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Ouch!
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
When did you get back?
Where'd you get that dress?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, George, George!
Great!  Find one for me.
Wheee!  Faster!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
I can't wait to get there.
Oh, shit.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
Why'd they decide to move?
Where're we going?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
On your own time?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Chief?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
How long ago?
Mike's out there.
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Do I have to?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Pop....
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Wait a minute....
There is nothing to discuss.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The what?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
What?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
Bullshit.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
When?
Can I go swimming?
Hang on!
How old is your cousin?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
The wind drift is lateral.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
What're we going to do in the mean time?
But first, a little juice....
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
You do everything your parents tell you?
What's wrong?
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
You're going out.
Yeah.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
It hasn't adjusted.
Thank you.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Pre-opening jitters.
And what else is bothering you?
It's his work.
Not enough loving.
Are you scared?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
It's romantic down here.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Michael...
Here.
Finally.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
What do you mean, we don't?
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Go where?
Nobody told me.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
You look like an orange worm.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Believe me, I am.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
He's big as a bloody bus!
Musclehead?
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Sure am.
Sean, do you have herpes?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
Told you you'd like it.
No...  It can't be.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Reach for the limit I always say.
How far away is filter number four?
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Come on, let's go.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
You want to show this?
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
It'll grow on you.
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
You want to try your hand at something...?
All he did was kiss me....
Beginning of what?
Michael!  This thing working?
Stop that....
Are you all right?
The fish.  Check it....
A big one....
Don't be late.
In a minute....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Dad died from a heart attack....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
I want you to give up your work....
You're having a good time....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
Flies the plane....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I don't know how....
What's wrong?
A drink with an umbrella in it....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
I have two right feet.
Want to go for a little ride?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Come on, Hoagie....
Matt?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Okay...we got it together....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
We lost it....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Shove it....
What the hell are you doing?
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
I'll take care of it.
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
The van?
Did you bring it with you?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
What about that kid, Ross?
Yeah, he can go ...
How's the new residence?
There's nothing in the files?
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
We're going.
I haven't got it.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Stop it.
She wasn't lying about the van.
Sure.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
What exactly you doing, John?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
Can I see your hands?
Me?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
What color was it?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
No.
Are you wearing a uniform?
Oh.
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
You're looking worried again, Helena?
He doesn't need my help.
What are you doing, Travis?
Why?
You think John would like it?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
No no...
Well, thanks.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
-- especially one like this.
Truth?
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
What --
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Why do you love me?
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
I'm sorry, I --
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
I got it.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
You love me now, don't you?
You are not allowed to act this way.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
Is that your porty or mine?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Not everyone has what you have.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
How can I make your life better?
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
One-two-three, swing.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
No, Dr. Grant says...
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
What did you say?
It's not safe.
Well what?
What?...WHAT!?
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
How was your trip? Profitable?
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
We could co-write a paper.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
I'd better get going.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Know what this is?
Why?
Do you have any kids?
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Well that's good.
How did you know?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Are you looking for a problem?
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Well, is he?
What?
What is?
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
What do they want?!
Come on!
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Ian.  It's guano.
We have to send someone to look for him!
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
How long will this take?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Pretty sure.
Did I say jerk?
Once we have control again we - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Okay, who's the jerk?
Why would they care what we think?
Oh, shit.
- - like birds - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
Do you see anything?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
I'm going with you.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
It's all right.
No.
That's right.  Will break through.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Unpredictability....
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Hola, Juanito
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
Why not?
I can't see.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
I read your book.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
These look kind of familiar.
I threw up.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
I can't!  I'm scared!
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You're married?
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
I didn't say you were scared.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Go away!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
We miss you.
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Mister Biller?
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Quite a circus.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Sorry.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
How do we prove it?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Add it to the list.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
You're not going to be there?
Where's he going?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You wanted to see me, sir.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
Was there something else?
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
What's the matter with you?
... Why take me into your confidence?
-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Holy God! The mummy walks!
I'm sorry ...
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
I can't imagine you crying.
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Did you fear for your life?
Are you gonna start it up?
Mm.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Oh no.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Oh no, I don't think --
What is it?
What about?
Gee.
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
You said it was!
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
Please.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Then, close the case.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I can't follow you.
Have you discussed this with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Are you closing the case?
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Where is the child?
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
Does that distress you?
What does?
What do you like best about her?
Greatest.
Show.
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
What about my orange juice?
Will she pick me up after school?
Okay...Same as usual...
Mom, I mean dad...
I think I'm going to throw up.
Daddy?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Are you going to get remarried?
Was there Burger King?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Objection!
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
And what is your present salary?
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
So do I.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
I don't recall.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
I was not a failure.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
'Night, Jim.
What the hell is this?
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Yes.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
How should I know?
So...what's so terrible about that?
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
And?
What?
Three months.  How can you tell?
Oh, Christ!
You ever see her talk to the walls?
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
How many onions does it say to use?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
She ever ask about me?
Ted.
Hey, that's terrific.
We must go, Holiness.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
I do, now.
Where will you keep them?
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
Holiness?
Who am I?
Will we be in this war?
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
I want to go down there.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Yes.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
You will not come?
Am I running away?
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
No.
Like my mother.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
You're a beautiful woman.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
His head was just... bitten off.
This is a setback.
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Kelly Scott.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Why are you here?  Really.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Okay.  We're up at six.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Like little children.  You okay?
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Sorry.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
No thanks.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Thanks for the... bandaid.
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Are we crazy?
It can't work.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
It was... something meeting you.
Different worlds, Jack.
No.
We set?
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
And this is how he came to the boat?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
What?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
What is this?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
They're coming right in.
Did you get him?
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
You and Kevin.
No.
No. He won't come after me.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Why?
Why not?
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It's much better than your shoes.
Five... so far.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
And the questionnaire...?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Go, Doctor.
The death of my father.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No. Tell me why.
No.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
But you could. You did.
Yes... I did.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Your "father"?
He did?
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
You do not know what you are saying!
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Some say that's the way of it.
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Will you consider that?
What?!
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
How long?
And if we're unlucky?
Any powder?
Will you men help us stop the French?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Yes, sir.
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Advance, Sergeant Major!
What is enough?
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
You mind if I take a look at this?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
Why Sixpack?
Was there such a thing?
Doc eat already?
That's an order!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
What are you doing?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
What about our quota?
No!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Forty-eight hours!
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
You let him get away!
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Clear for pickup.
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Don't spend all day down there.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
It saw us!
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
What's that?
I thought this was a pub.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
What can I do for you?
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
We gotta get those guns.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Yeah, one of them's out.
Right, his leg's going now.
Where?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
That's it all done, we are off.
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
You got it all?
Go on.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
I can't help you, Plank.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Look. Go on, look.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
What's left over?'
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
How many wings have they got between them?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
I don't know what the big deal is.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Please.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
You're dismissed, Private.
Out of the Army?
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
We're not running a dating service here.
How's business?
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
A .45--
Whole different story; isn't it?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Best part of the job.
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
I never met her.
Uncle Al--
I'm a colonel.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
Same as they done in Mexico.
PDA?
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
I have a B average.
How's your room shaping up?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
This place is a gold mine.
Right.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
So where does that put us?
Seriously.
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
You get much of that in here?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Eladio Cruz.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
That so?
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
No.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Bledso
Besides my father, I mean.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
You thought any more about our murder?
Charley Wade.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
We're building up tourism, Sam--
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve called for you.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
There must have been somebody.
Nobody's too busy.
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
I don't think you can take it personally--
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
You got in late last night.
It was for personal consumption.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Murdered him?
Something wrong?
He's all yours.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
No--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Yeah?
So what are we gonna do about this?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
Hello, L.A.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
You did.  Didn't you?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
He's a secretive man.
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
He taught all this to Swann?
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
You said you weren't with him for love.
It's okay.
Are you sure?
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't bother.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
You know Vinovich?
I only wear ties for funerals.
Are they all in the business?
How the fuck do you do that?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh Jeez.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Yeah, they told me.
Hello?
What are you doing here?
I'm thinking about it.
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Of course.
Really?
I don't remember.
Oh.
That's too scary.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You think so?
So, where'd you go today.
When are you leaving?
I'm going to miss you.
Charlotte?
Mr. Harris?
My stockings.
Hi, Lydia.
I don't know.
Like Japanese food.
Hello?
Great.
Hello? Yes?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
See you later.
Do you think it's done?
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
It's amazing  there!
Oh no...
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, like...
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I found them in your file box.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Yes.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
You'll do it?
You fucking bastard.
Why are you doing this to me?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Father, please don't die.
I do.
Why did he try to kill me?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
What are you looking for exactly?
Nothing yet.
Peter, let go of the chair!
There's nothing else here.
Are you alright?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Good of you to stop by.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
What do you mean by that?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
What's the matter with you?
Monica.  What are you doing here?
No I don't.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
That's not it.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
Which one for tomorrow?
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
Can I take your coat?
You could make a career by telling me where.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
A horse?
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
I found you someone.
I told him you looked like me.
What's up with that?
But?
Well, what do you know.
So...does it hurt?
I don't know.  A lot.
So?
What's that?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
So she's honest.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
When'd you get this?
What was that about?
It's okay, little baby.
Clothes.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Hey.
I've been trying to find you all day.
he's just playing, Q...
You forgot to be there.
What?
When did you decide all this?
Just something I'm trying.
What are the doctors saying?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Funny.  I never did.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
You visiting?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
You're serious.
Cause I don't get it.
What's going on?
Hey, girl.
No.
We should head over.
With who?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Why not?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Why?
Lucky kid.
I ain't a damn liar.
What do you want?
After five years.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
You ok?
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
What do you want? Why are you here?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
Please put your clothes on, please --
Honey.
OPEN THE DOOR.
No.
Yeah.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
You mind if I check things back here?
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Just Jim.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Great, bye.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Well.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
-- you the resident here?
You live alone?
-- can I get you?
-- what kind?
Where's the news department at this studio?
What happend, what's going on?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DAD --
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Did you listen to me?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
What happend?
I have love.
...please...
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
I paid you back.
Braces?
You don't need braces.
I've been a good worker --
Give me your keys, Don.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
I think you have the wrong number.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I would just want to clear some things up:
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
the valley?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Psychology major?
And "Frank?"
Are you asking me a question?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
How long...you think?
Uh. huh.
What? What? What now?
You're just come in --
There's no disturbance.
I preffer to stand.
I didn't do anything.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
What happend to you?
Are you ok?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
Slowly or quickly?
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
I don't.
I don't know....
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I think that you know.
But you can't say....
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Pink Dot.
Mmm.Hmmm.
mmm.hmm.
Bottled Water?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Be ready at two --
You coulda been in front --
You ready to keep winning?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
..sorry...
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
God smiled upon us.
What -- ?
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Louis, please -- !
What had you to do with this, Mother?
How can I serve you in this?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
Your Majesty...
Wh-- Wha--
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
How is he?
Hang himself?!
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
And why are you so glum?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What do we do now?
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
It's been too long.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Raoul is everything to me.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
One for all.  All for one.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Sire!  I -- How did you --
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
You mind if I ride with you?
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
Find out for me.
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
What?  Wait a minute -
Did you read today's paper?
So where are you from?
You always carry a gun with you?
No, but I'm listening.
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Tubbs, it's me.
Holy shit -
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Donut?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
You must be going somewhere.
I'm stranded out here.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Long gone, huh?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
In thirty-five minutes.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
How long do I have?
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Run it.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There has to be.
Will?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Where the hell's Graham!
When do you need it?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I'll see you later. All right?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Do you feel privileged?
Do you see?
'No' what?
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
It's Will Graham...
Okay.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
I don't want to do that,
'Intimate? !"
I understand he cut you pretty good...
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Do you remember what you said?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Come home with me.
What's the problem, Molly?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Yes. Is Molly there?
That's right.
What do you want?
Yes. Who are you?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Are you gonna kill him?
How?
Did the girl die?
And Hobbs died?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
And?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Why should I tell you?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Do you dream much, Will?
May I keep the file?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Sitcom...?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Andy?
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Tony Clifton.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Right...
Excuse me -- ?
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
How can you be so casual??!
You're NOT DYING!
I'm gonna quit.
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
"Philosophically"?
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
"Burlesque"?
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
What's in Memphis?
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
What?!
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You don't, do you?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
No, it's all right.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Just get me outta here.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Do you still want to meet?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
... am I dead?
What are you doing?
This isn't real?
I know what you're trying to do --
Do you know why you didn't make it?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Now left and that's it in front of you.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
From what?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
What does that mean?
What did she tell you?
Are you all right?
What happened?  What did you see?
What?
No, you're not.
Can you fly that thing.
It's a city?
Holy shit!
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Operator.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
No.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
I gotta get the stuff.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
Let's get out of here.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Take a drink!
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
Well, maybe you missed something?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Bore.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
What's the matter with this kid?
Scumbag--
Come on.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
Just keep him quiet.
Yeah.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
I know you do, darling.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
-- Black.
I don't like cake.
I haven't been the father to you that --
Honey --!
What do you do that for?
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
What are you eating.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
You're taking this too far, Drew.
I didn't say.
It doesn't matter.
May I interrupting?
I'm not stepping anywhere --
I'm all excited --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Yeah, something he goes by --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Is there any more to it?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Why?
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What are their feelings?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
I'm going to put a stop to this!
He said that?
What you then?
Doctor lady make it irey.
No, I come to see Doctor.
I am.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Confused, huh?  About what?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
Come again?
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
Where are you going?
'To bed'?
I'm sorry about --
-- Could you?
Yes?
For how long?
I like you in a black tie.
We know so little about each other --
Will it?
I believe that, don't you?
I'm still here.
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Susan --
You think so?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
How long have I got?
When you go, I go.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
Sounds fair enough.
A 'deal'?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Joe --?
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
And more.
Why did you go to the hospital?
About Susan?
Okay.  Goodnight.
Yes, I saw you see me.
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Uh --
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
No.
Joe, don't do this --
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
You are --?
That's me.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
What do you mean?!
'Take me'...?  Where?
Get what?
I'm sorry --
Yes what?
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Eddie?
We're all here, Bill --
Drew's aboard?
Drew told me.
I don't like to interfere.
...There's a start for a meeting.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Are you okay?
You know each other?
Where is he?
I don't know, I can't say --
What a night.
I love you, Daddy --
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
Not at all.
I've got to go --
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
You said you liked me.
39.
Well, what then?
Should I wear it?
My wife.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
What?
Jimmy?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Is that what your little note says?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Such as?
Why would you do that?
What's wrong?
Who?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Yes.
Dying.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
You've read it a hundred times.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
What the hell you want to go there for?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
Who?
You really want to find this guy?
You're living.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
So what are you gonna do now?
Prove it.
Unfinished business.
She has no idea who I am.
What sort of questions?
Like what?
Why?
What's wrong?
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
Yeah.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
What do you think?
I thought we had to meet the Man.
We want it back.
What's "nothing"?
Your father?
How's he not your husband?
Mojitas...?
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Good samba dancing...?
Hola, chica.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
You afraid of violence?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
What's our deal?
And there's Dmitri...
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
So what do you want?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
From whom...?
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Yeah...?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Oh, good...
C'mon, man!
So?
Okay...see you soon.
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
And as an investment in the future...
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You sure you heard what I said?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
He's got taxi fare.
For money.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
You don't seem like no fag...
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
You're what?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
You want me to leave?
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Get lost.
Getchmis olsun
'Figgers.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
Dad...I'm...
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Yes...?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Just what?
Girlfriend?
And you?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
We go back.
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
What?
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
It's already been cut.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
What?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Why the suit?
You're ayip!
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Any luck?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
Just inner chambers...
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Do you think we did the right thing?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Honey, just leave it.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
No, Jesus, no.
Rub it on the windows!
It worked before...
You go first. I'll be right below you.
C'mon...
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
What's this?
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
What do you want to know?
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Sure.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
No, what is it?
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Then who did?
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
It'll only take a second.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
I hope you like it.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
You've been out of your room.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Yes, Paul.
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Just leave it, all right?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Yeah. They're in the semis.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I thought you were over it.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
To win?
Sort it all out.
Nyah!
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
What are you doing here?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
No.  Should I?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
Excuse me?
And then what?
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Something else?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
I don't.  No exactly.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
..I'm fine..and you?
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Roger that.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
But why tell us?
What kind of show.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
I'm walking.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
What are you going to do?
Okay...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Youíre in Prague?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
What?
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What are we downloading?
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
On what?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Why, may I ask?
Mm - Hmmm...
Very good.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Zero body count.
Merci.
Claire.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
Would you remove your hat please?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Iíve got a shadow.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Jim...?
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Jim, itís over.
Why don't you take a look?
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Itís working.
The Shawfish?
Who's dead?
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Okay.
You haven't said anything.
Here.  Ti amo. 
I'm getting married.
He got hit by a bus.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Mona?
What are you doing here?
You're my father.
Yes!
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Loretta. What's that smell?
I like it well done.
Where'd Johnny find you?
Why?
I don't know.
No.
How many men since then?
Stupid yourself.
Why you talking to me?
You don't know nothing about it.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
To the bed.
What?
I'm marrying your brother!
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Snap out of it!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
But that's cause he don't know!
What?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Thank you!
They get some turnout for this stuff.
This is your place.
This is where we're going!
I'm afraid of who I am.
I got things to do.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
You don't want the fish.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Have Something.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Yes, on the floor.
Then let's set the date.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Did he tell her?
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Your hair's different.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Do you love him, Loretta?
Hi.
What about the moon?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
We just come from the bank.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
Don't fight.
Moving in?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
So.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Who was that?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
Loretta...
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
Thanks, comrade.
Then why are you eating alone?
You knew that man?
Temperature's dropping.
People home.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Rita. Rita.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
I see.  Yes, of course.
Halt!  Who goes there?
Get away!
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
King of the WHO?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
What, "is"?
You're a liar.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Well, what are you then?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
What is your name?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Ni!
What?
What?
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Oh, shut up.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Sorry ...
Good idea, O Lord!
What is your quest?
That's easy!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Did you kill all those guards?
Do you want to come and have a drink?
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
Who are you?
The Castle Anthrax?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
... I Bet you're gay.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Bravely ran away, away.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
What are you doing?!
She'll get over it.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
It's what the maids are for.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
Hey, Barney.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Gesture?
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
Awaiting my orders.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
Do you hunt?
You're injured.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Was there never ambition?
Then I envy yo.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
So...?
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
They don't see it.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What is it, John?  John?
I was told you were in a fight.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
Is that not enough?
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
Erysipelas.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Why was I not informed?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Who told them that?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
Talk to me.
Sick?
Hello?
I have to talk to you.
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Can you turn off the game?
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
That's what I thought.
You mean we learn the rules...
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
Alex...
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Christ...no time...
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
What did I say?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
I understand.
Yes...what is it?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
A car ... a car accident.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Yes?
What's wrong?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No. Just the coffee.
Strange to be calling yourself.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
Rita... I know what you're doing.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Palmdale.
Not here...no thanks.
No...
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
McCay knows ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
How long till the room fills ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I... I .....
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Do you know where you're going ?
What about you ?
What are you DOING here ?
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
I thought you made this place ?
Be very, very quiet...
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Is it over ?
Don't.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
Of course.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Will he make it out ?
What's next ?
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
What an incredible view !
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
I think we should follow him...
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
Do you still teach?
People said she looked like me.
THANK YOU.
So, what's on your mind?
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
There's still a big spot on the floor.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Yeah.
Totally.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Reason? What reason?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
She's beautiful.
Hi.
What's the matter?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Hi.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
This is really very nice of you.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
There's water in your bathroom.
Don't wake up Vada.
He said it was a gift.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Boyfriend?
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
It's dangerous!!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
Muh??
What's that?
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
Excuse me?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
He's so tiny.
Beidermeyer?
Hey, you didn't pay me!
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
You are perfectly healthy.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Stiffs??
I need the job.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
I had a good time tonight.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Dance with me?
Rock?
Did you ahh, love him?
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Of course not.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Yes..
Hi Vada.
What are you doing.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Did I kill my mother?
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Why?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Sure.
How much does it cost?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
No....
My Dad was funny?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Maybe black means you're happy?
Shut your big fat mouth!
He won't give it to me.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I'm hemorrhaging.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Thomas J?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Hey look at this, no feet!
At what?
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
If I do it, can we go?
Hey look at this!
THIS!! 
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Hi Vada.
I do, she's real funny.
You can come to my house for dinner?
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Close your eyes.
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
I've lost interest.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
But I can't be dry.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
How about...
But he sure can kiss.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
Exactly what?
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I think he's been fired.
Well, you're a little early...
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
Should I whistle down a cab?
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
You're not eating.
You never eat when you're despondent.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Takes me back.
Will she like it?
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
This is her family and her fault.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
Maybe it's happy there.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
You going today?
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
What?
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
Barbara Jean.
You want anything?  A drink?
Okay.
Yes, but we're just singing.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
What?
Yes, sir. I need a room
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Who's that?
You in music?
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Do you ever do any writing?
Hello.
Oh?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Wrong.
When did you think it would happen?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
They said go see the chaplain.
I can do benefits
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Probably a little too long.
Come on back to bed.
Hi.
Why?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Ah... Peter Finch.
It's not bad.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
You got something you want to do?
Who isn't?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Do you have a back up.
What I'd like to do---
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
I admire them.
Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
The entire wing?
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
How's it working, Scotty?
Rollin'...and speed!
But how can you say that?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ya know, I was.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Could we go with you and film it?
Who's going to buy me a beer?
Fill her up?
Want to talk to you.
I know.
Yeah.
She done moved to Detroit.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
In Birmingham.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Hell!
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
But I would like to see you again.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Ain't your fault.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Hi.
Thank you.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
How come you keep askin'?
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Day work.
A whole lot, Frankie.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
See you, Duff.
They all got families to support.
'You Will Anderson?
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Take it easy, Pop.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
How often does he get like that?
Come back some other time, will you?
How 'you gonna live?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
So I been told.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What you lookin' for, mon?
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Did you trace it?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You've got your orders.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
What elders?
She's ready to go.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Where the hell have you been?
What are you talkin' about?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
You're late.
What about the route to the core?
Where did you here that?
What is it?
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
...Feels like you.
Yeah... fine.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
It is?
What?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
You don't think I can do it.
Wings?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Uhh, no.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
What if I say no?
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Rob's?
Wow. This must be big.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
This seat taken?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Yes.
That is so sad --
Josie, you look Rufus.
Are you having fun?
By name.
Shock.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Coming...
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
Where are you going?
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Wanna join your little friend?
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Who told you to choke up that way?
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
You're fucked in the head.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Are you sure?
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Here.
So, you feeling anything?
About not finding any bogey men?
Yeah?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
There's a Jesse on the phone.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
I know who's trying to kill you.
Nancy!
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
It's over.  It's over.
Crossed over?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Ms. Thompson.
You're late.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
To who?
Then maybe you're ready.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
I've heard crazier things this week.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
What was that?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
What did you think?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
That's enough, Kincaid.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Sorry about that...
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Nothing.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
With a goat playing a violin.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Well...
How are you doing?
This is certainly... ah...
Hi.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Excuse me.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
He's bringing a girl?
Yup.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Still loves you though.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes.  What do you think?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Cappuccino as ordered.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Do you ever masturbate?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Oh God no.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Can I help you?
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
What did she say?
Which was?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
How was she?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
But you have no proof.
Yes, Mister Harding?
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Sorry to have bothered you.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
You men remain seated!
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Whatcha boys playin'?
That's okay, kid...
So long suckers.
In ya go...
Ahhh, Billy...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Wait a minute...
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
Let's go, for Christsakes...
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
They must be up there!
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
I'll bet a dollar.
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Okay, sucker.
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What's your plan, Mack?
I'm the coach!
Don't you have any clubs?
Hear what?
When?
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Jesus God...
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Doc, what can I tell ya?
You bet, Doc!
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
You look pretty healthy to me.
How do ya know that?
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
There they are!
How 'bout twenty?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
He is your husband, no?
She was your sister.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
What?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
A very large pig.
...has a prior commitment.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
You...
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Damon Bradley...
To the foot doctor.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Why are you asking me this?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
He's out by the pool right now.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
What?...
So were you.
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Is something the matter?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
What would you call it?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Really?...
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Hello.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Any night.
Sure.
So, what are we waiting for?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Is that bad?...
It's still the new year...
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
Live happily ever after.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
You think he misses me at all?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
And he is living proof.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Kate is that you?
What about Larry?
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
I have to talk to her.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Right now?
I'll come over when I'm ready.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
But my own kid bro—
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
They play pretty rough.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
You know how the Sisters are.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
In braids? That's right.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
How do you like that one?
Want to go out and have one with me?
Wham... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Terry!
Why, Terry, who said it was?
What are you crying for?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
You... .
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
Edie...
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
Your gun.
This is my business.
What did you say?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
What do you think?
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I think you could have.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Really?
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Terry?  What do you want?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
You got some nerve.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
If I could get my hands on you...
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Something's making that music.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Can't we get out of here?
Look!
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You're talking nonsense.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
When!?
The moon is almost gone!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I understand, Master
You better hope there is.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then it is some service you desire of us.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
What're you talking about?
Oh, is this Adele?
Lie face down on the floor.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Ask him his name.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Oh, man.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Nice disguise.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Now that's a really big house.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
Come <i>on</i>.
Hello, Daniel.
What'd you talk about?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Sure, Daniel.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
You get the key?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Hello?
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
I bet.  How much?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
You know how to use one a these?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
How'd you get this number?
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Think I could have them back?
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
You like taking risks.
You were going to see her?
You coming back?
You're not dumb.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
I hear six.
Looks like tonight.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
It's a little late for me.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
Have they got Midge up there?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
Meaning?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Glenn, take the exit.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Right now, son.
That was some shit, huh?
You're a fighter?
You're not my type.
No.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Can we change the subject?
"Hey, yourself."
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
How do I look, mama?
Thank you...
What?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Foley's got it.
We have a problem here?
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You're Walker, right?
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Good shooting, Danny!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Then why are you looking for her?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
We gotta face some facts here.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
Get me into a plane!
What's there?
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
You hear my okay?
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
Sorry.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
Then wh-where do we land?
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
What's your name?
What do you get for winning?
You take care, Dorie.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
Oh, this is Betty.
What else can we do?
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
It must of been a convincing letter.
What if the Japanese did invade?
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
I have'na been able ta --
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
They're waiting. Come on.
I'll call you Later.
I don't get it.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Want me to drive you home later?
Looking good out there.
I'm sorry Charlie.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What are you doing here?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Did you study for the test?
Are you for real?
I beg your pardon?
You don't?
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
This is great reefer.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Thank God for that.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
I closed my Christmas club.
He'll win.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Does everybody have to hear?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Mom!
I have a note.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Where have you been?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
What are you doing?
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
And the butter.
I remember that dress.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
Dancing with you.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
What a great kite.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
I was building a doggy door.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Out?
What happened to you?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
What's wrong?!
Hey! How was your first day at school?
What?
Who was that?
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Are we interrupting, Andy?
Thanks, Walter.
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Thanks, you guys.
It could be parasites, an infection...
Jerk... What did you say?
What's wrong with you?
What's that mean?!
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
There is no relevant precedent.
I'm a law suit.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
What?
I've considered that.
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
Are you a good lawyer?
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Leave that.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Good school. What year?
Great.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Don't know, Joe.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Right.
Not when I was in the Navy.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
This would be a good time to break for the day...
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
Oh, Lord....
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
You did this? To yourself?
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
You barely know them.
What do my eyes see?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
He used that?
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
How much?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Why did I fall on you?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
I don't suppose....
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
What're you doin'?
"God is Great," yes?
What the hell are these?
Very big beads.
Well, what's it look like now?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
I apologize.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
The best. But we won't need them.
As you wish.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Do you have to work tonight?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Got your sensors?
No.
Any particular reason?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
What happened?
Gone.
She comes along too.
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
How so?
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Of course.
What is your proposal?
Tell him to pull back!
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
It's him...Landon.
Are you going to take her with you?
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
Would you like to come along?
Do you believe him?
So what's the problem?
Sarge?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
You lame Taylor?
Where's he from?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
First time?
Dawn! That was it!
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
You volunteered for this shit man?
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Merle?
Whew! - where that come from?
Right on.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Indefinitely?
No thanks?
I think you're drunk.
They might think I was running away from something.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Nice of him.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
They're going to arrest me.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
No.  I paid him off.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Would I want to?
Me?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
What this?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
We try to be decent.
They call me Jeff.
I can't answer that.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
What are your rates?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
And without much discrimination.
So you're not a cop.
Could be.
It was lying where on the balcony?
Time for a little chat?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
It could have been an accident.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Right.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
You can find out.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
I am a fool.
Now, you're being beastly.
And if you didn't believe me?
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
So far.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
How long have you had it?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Of course.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
To Ann.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
Shall we go?
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
How's Mary?
Congratulations.  Who with?
And some of that.  Sorry.
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Again?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Blasé and epicene.
You approve!
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
That's enough of that.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Hello.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
It was last year.
Don't point it at James!
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
You gonna pull?
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You gotta tell me where she is.
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
Yeah?  What?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
They don't go for the vault?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
... so I started tailing him.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Time for lunch.
The hell are they?!
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Nice place.
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Those are cold.
Ouch.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
What story did you give to Davis?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
What have you got in mind, General.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
What in God's name...?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
You looking' for some company?
That's ridiculous.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Stolen?
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
For the whole night?
Get in.  This side.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
And why do you say that?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
It's a very good year.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Do you ever... enjoy it?
No?  Why's that?
All right.  How much for the week?
But you want days too.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
I'm sorry.
Why not?
Okay.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fuck off.
Do I look okay?
What if someone tries to steal it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
I've never been on a plane before.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Business.
You're packing.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Love this car!  Is it new?
I want to.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
What!?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
I don't think there's any sense in --
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yeah, what?
I'm just going to my room.
I got a dress.
You'll like it fine.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
They will serve salad.
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Hi, Barney!
Are you looking for something in particular?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Catch your breath.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
We'll never survive.
Singed a bit, were you?
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
You're quick.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
-- Fezzik, please --
You've been mostly dead all day.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
What?
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Yes.
Rise and report.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Now?
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Slow going?
Sorry.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
There's something I ought to tell you.
Who are you?!
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Go in, get after her!
You guessed wrong.
Think it'll work?
Your grandfather's here.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
Help!
What did I do?
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Don't help me.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
You, Blum go Motel.
We make love?
By the sacred memory...
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Of course not.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Why?
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
I still feel...
What should I know?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
I was getting to that!
What thing could we be in together?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Arbogast said...
In a hurry.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Where'd you go to college?
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
You going to wait here for me?
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
It's regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
We could laze around here a while longer.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
For what?
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
You have something most girls never have.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Is your time so empty?
Except you.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
You slept here all night?
Is there?
We have a problem.
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Barefaced.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I'll get your bags.
My mother is not dead!
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Was that all?
No mother.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
No-
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
What's down there?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
Your father?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
Yes, why?
What are you laughing at?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
But what about lunch?
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
I won't let you say that!
But it was really my fault.
What! What are you talking about?
Are you giving me this straight?
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Which one is me? The horse?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Call the Homicide Squad!
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Do you know George Winton?
That's the one.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
What do you mean police dog?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
You weren't going with her?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
How much money have you got?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I will only be gone about half an hour.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
I've been dreaming about you.
What?
We flopped the first time out.
Of what?
Dysfunctional --
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Actually, I am, though.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Buddy, you're just a child.
You better quit that.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What'd you say, Brother?
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
There goes Mother.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
This is my place and you can't have it.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
What's goin' on?
Why is it taking so long?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Are they polar bears, too?
Is her husband sick or something?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Please do.
Of course.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
She hasn't actually done anything...
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Yes, sir.
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Your baby?
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Galley what?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Yes, go on.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Yes, Ma'am.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I... I can explain...
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
And... ?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Kittle...
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
I can work this.
We should slow down.
Jiminy Christmas.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
That's them trying to kill us.
What's the plan?
Why do I always have to sit in back?
Birth control's important.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
No, we're stealing.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
I'm gonna get beside him.
Can't be worse than you.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
What... ?  Not you too?
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
The gang's all here!
You always did have style.
This shit was Ming.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
There's still good in him.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I have felt him, my Master.
Wouldn't miss it.
Luke.
You got her warmed?
Vader's on that ship.
I thought she was with you.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
What did he say?
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Oh!
Over there! Two more of them!
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
Come with me.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Well, I'm sorry.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
Janet!
Yes.
Yes Brad.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Oh....Say something.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Brad...
Hello.
You did right.
You're OK by me.
Feeling
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
...How's the turtle food this week?
Looks quiet, y'know.
...Aren't you skating?
What's funny?
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Why?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...What?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Don't you open them anymore?
Like?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Is everything all right?
...Can't do it.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
No... I can't!
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Don't do that again!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
What's ya name again?
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Ya sure?
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
I'm sure you are.
What?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What was I gonna say?
Goodnight, Rocky.
...What?
Did ya win?
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
What's happened is freak luck.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Please, kid.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Wanna keep goin'?
...What kinda dog is this again?
Yo, Paulie.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Don't get mental, man.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
...Maybe I better forget it.
Why?
It don't bother me none.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
What gaps?
You ballin' her?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
I'll tear his head off.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
What's this, Roger?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
He's a riot.
So you decided to help him after all?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Does it hurt?
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
I didn't know who I could trust.
So where is it?
What the hell is that?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
I got him on loan from Disney.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
Does this help?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Two bits.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Keep reading...
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Romeo! Romeo!
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Good marrow, father!
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
A most courteous exposition.
Pink for flower.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Of course.
I don't know.
Well I don't!
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
What is?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Lose them!
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
I still am.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
Are you alright?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Where's the case?
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Whoever hired us.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Sent it where?
So what do we do?
He's tough, your American friend.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Long enough to shoot back.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
I needed to know.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I borrowed that, too...
I've seen a lot of people die before.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Give me a cigarette.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
That's a good question.
What happened to it?
Why didn't you kill her?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
What the hell happened here?
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
No.  We can't.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Not bad enough to kill him.
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
We've got to go now, then.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
It's too late...
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Whoa, Earl!
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Hi.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
Test the product?
I don't know.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Sheriff Hogan --
Yeah.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Whatever...
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
Hi ma.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
Are you hungry?
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
Well I don't know --
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
This isn't right...
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
What the hell is that?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Winner six!
Invitation, please.
The band has been playing over an hour.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
What?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
I'm busy at the moment.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Carter, get off that stage!
What'd I say?
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Hello.
Where are you going?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
You.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Follow the Rich White Man?
Who?
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
It's a long story.
No.  It was my singing.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
What's she doing?
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Steamed dumplings?
Very nice.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Let's go.
What is Mac out?
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
No you didn't!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
What is this?
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
I didn't know which side you were on.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
You know what a phone booth is?!
What is your name?
He stole my wheel!
It's the same thing!
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
What about them?
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
You know War?
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Œhood.
Not anymore.
You're killin' me here.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
You OK?
Yo, Johnson...
Hmmmm?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Where do we find him?
I do.
I am so sorry about your men.
I will not have friends in America.
You look awful.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
-- It's for you, Ike.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
I think so.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
You look... uh... You look fine.
I'll have the same.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
Yes I do!
To who?  Are you asking me?
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
You were not.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I'm going to kill myself.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Lighten up, wahine.
He's going to be the pastor?
Grandma!
Maggie, it's just a joke...
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
Am I what they had in mind?
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Who is it?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
You go.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
You okay?
What was that about up there?
You're a basket case.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
What?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
What about the letter?
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No, I know that part --
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
You'll find out.
You'll see.
You'll like it.
Write her.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Will she scratch up your back?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Jed's got cables.
This one's for both of us.
Listen to this --
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Jonah!
Thank Victoria for dinner.
God, she's beautiful.
Have you seen my wallet?
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Did too.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
You look good.
I thought you were never going to call me.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
I read an article about this ...
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Got any more ideas?
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Forget it.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
Tell me.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Are you Australian?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
What?
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
It's not that easy.
I can't.
I can't leave.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
How far out of town?
It gets me through the day.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
I'm kind of busy.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Why not?
How you holding up?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Danny?
What's this?
Why?
What the hell is that?
What?
You don't trust me?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
By not disgracing her memory!
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Can we talk price?
You're serious?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Come on, guys ...
Now get talkin'
No last name?
Thanks for not judging me.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
What're your taking down?
You've got no choice.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Danny?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
He knows somebody ratted him.
What's on the other end of this thing?
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
You think that's a good idea?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Where's Bubba?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
We left them eighty-eights.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Not yet.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
How about that jeep?
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Upham?
I wasn't made for this.
I've been humming it.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
What is it?
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
What'd you say, Captain?
Caen?
What about the company?
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
What do you think?
What are we going to do?
Uh, oh.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
I'd like to go, sir.
Don't do that again.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Shit, sir.
Who cares?
Frogs?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
How fast?
What's the profile?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Thanks, I like yours too.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Keep it.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
But you never had a first date.
That's not even a scam.
Then what's love?
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Did you sleep with her?
Lloyd is doomed.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
Why?
Visit her at the home.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
You should be.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Did he ever get rough with you?
Hello.
You will?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.
So you're monumentally busy?
Well...
I'll go.
Whoa.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
It's just you and your dad, right?
Sure I do.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
So what's your job this summer?
No, I'm serious.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Oh.
Stop by later.
Okay, bye.
Okay, this is important...
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
No.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
You told your dad?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Then don't do it.
What?
Okay.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Oh boy.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
I love you man.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Luck.
Should I stay?
It's bad business.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
When?
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
Where are the guards?
God bless you, sir.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
How you feeling, all right?
Good.  How's it going?
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
Oskar, good of you to come.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
I was just the accountant.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Better this month than last?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
I got to go, I'll see you.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
I can do it, Captain.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Outside.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
Hang up...call...
Yes.
Cici. Who's this?
I did that.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
And are the police sure about that?
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
I think he's doing Dolly.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Where's Sid?
No way.
About what?
Lemme take you home.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Two.
She's got guards with her.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
I don't play games.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Who is that guy?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
How many guys they have on you?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
I hate scary movies.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
What do you want?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
What do you mean?
What?!
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Four? There are five.
Are you sure?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Oh yeah, how?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
You used to say that was our strength.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Jennifer needs me.
Stop following me.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Thank you.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Geez.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Just because you knew her?
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
No.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
You're dead!
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
I didn't kill anybody.
Owwww...
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
No...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Who did you call?
I thought you were...
NO! Don't believe him.
Why did you kill my mother?
Hello?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
So why did you dial it again?
Hello.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Why do you want to know my name?
That's not what you said.
Nah, I don't think so...
Listen, asshole...
I wanna play a game.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
What's his name?
Now for the real question.
But you're doing so well.
...please... no...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
You tricked me...
What door am I at?
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
And why is that? Has something happened?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Any word on my Dad?
Should I be worried?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
What? What?
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
Please. You owe me.
Many times.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
Can you see me right now?
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Stu was with me last night.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
Jesus, this place is packed.
You coming tonight?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Do you believe this shit?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Come on, Sid.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
How you feeling?
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
What?  What?
I don't believe it.
Give me the gun.
You didn't know.
Where we headed?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You've made a good life for yourself...
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Not here.
Drop it.
Who said this was murder?
You think it was poison?
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
This doesn't make any sense.
How's that?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
There must be something.
The fingerprints.
Why would we?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
So they ran our list.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
Think about it...
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Oh, you want to stay now?
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
What is it?
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Put your gun down!!
Are you absolutely certain?
This painting...
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
But Mose Harper said...
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Let's get along...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
He cometh forth like a...
I didn't give any order to fire!
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
How'd you come by this?
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
I beg your pardon?
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Easy on that!
What you goin' to do?
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Hey! What's the idea...?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
They'll be back...
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Don't go takin' that stuff...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
It wasn't much of a letter...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
She'd be about thirteen now...
Where?
I mean the armchair!
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Who was that?
Martin, it's not funny!
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
So, did you sleep good?
Ellen.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
You did not like the speech?
You are a gentleman.
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
What do you want, Kit?
We will all be put in the clink.
How much?
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Most interesting.
How long has it been?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Where is the play?
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
No Juliet?!
Who is she this time?!
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Where are you going?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
By God, I wish I knew.
We are lost.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Ethel.
"Good morrow, cousin."
"But new struck nine."
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Oh my lady, my love!
Can you love a fool?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
I am.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
Even your play.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh, Will!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
I know how to fight!
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Will you read it for me?
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
I have spoken with your father.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Your aunt?
She sings too?
But what of Lord Wessex?
"Poet?"
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
Alex, I don't have the time --
He's still here.
When are you going to let the police know?
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
What is this?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Well?
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Are you recording it?
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
And you like it?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Well, she had problems --
Aroused and inflamed.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
You see, they don't really know me.
He's got a car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
You want me to kick it open?
I wonder how he did it?
What are you doing?
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Now you thought of that, not me.
I refuse.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
What?
It's about me and David.
Don't you ever stop?
So, uh...
What?
Can you afford this place?
It's about the burglary.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Is this where no one stays?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Would you like to talk about it?
Expecting anyone?
I'm sorry.
So let's go.
You get the job done.
What guy that died?
Here?.
Would you like to come in?
Writing seems easy.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
It was some guy called Brian.
Shall I answer it?
For what?
No. I haven't seen them.
Diseases.
I suppose so.
Chicken salad.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Then what's the problem?
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
I just thought you'd like to know --
Lester.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I know.
Nummers.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
Your husband?
But aren't you...
That headboard.
You know what I'm talking about.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Chopped liver?
Did you hear me?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
... just, you could look very heavy...
No kidding.
Yeah...
I am not!
George!
Jesus...
I don't know. Probably not.
You don't seem very sure.
What's wrong?
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
And?
It was after you, baby. After you.
George... how about Felicia?
You know what I'm talking about.
No! Don't! Please!
Look, either come in or stay out!
He still having parties?
-- what?
-- ass and legs --
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Where are you going?
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
I don't know... Jackie?
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Yeah!
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
I have to see you.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
George --
When is that, George?
What?
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
I know, honey.
Bullshit.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Yes, yes, I did.
What're you here for?
You need a cut.
Said what!
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
But what?
It's good you want to do something, George.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Tonight?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
Sorry, honey, I...
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
This really ought to be layered...
You live like a pig.
What do they look like?...
Godammit, George...
I wanna hear about it.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
I mean, how did that happen?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
Awww --
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Here.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Well, he is.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Well, what is it, honey?
How much?
What?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- uhh-huhh...
-- He reached up and tore them.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
-- why?
What's wrong?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- there's not much room --
You seem disappointed.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Do you have children?
Do you have something against traveling?
No of course not.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
No.  I'm just a little tired.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
Maybe he showed me something.
Yeah.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Tony.
What sort of injury did he have?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
It's okay, really.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
No, we don't mind.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
Hi, babe.
Sure is.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Somebody did that to him.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away...!
Stay away from me.
Very nice to meet you.
five months of peace is just what I want.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
Right there.
I'd better collect my family first.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Hi.
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Went shopping. Why?
Are you all right, Marty?
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
There's something else scary.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
You all right, Marty?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
What is it?
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
Was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
It could have been anything, Marty.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
What if I say no?
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
Really.
I think I hear it!
You know, I just might!
SING!
But I'm fearful!
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
His ashes?
You bastard!
Sure.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Where did that come from?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Is this... choir practice?
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
Jackpot!  Two buckets
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Soprano or alto?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Hopeless I
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We need experience.
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Who are all these people?
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
You were unhappy?
The reason?
I see.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
What's wrong with my life?
It never solves anything.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
You're my Olympic event.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
A vote?
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
What?
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
So I don't shop.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
I just need a few more weeks,
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Really?  Lieutenant?
Vince knows you're here.
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
We're looking for Mike.
Get her!
There she is!
I can't see anything in here!
You didn't shoot!
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
I don't understand.  Where is she?
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
If we could speak alone.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
What the hell are you doing?
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
It is sacrilege!
Your superiors are two days away!
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Very few, if any.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
What is it?
All I saw was their lantern.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Why... why are you like this?
This is farewell.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
He has proposed to me twice.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
These scars.  How did you get them?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Must I hear this?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I apologize if I worried you.
My God... what has happened?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Can you help?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Go home.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She has confessed.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
Yeah, they's good all right.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Thank ye.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
Well, what did you want?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Leave.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Sure, I guess.
You like that Vaughan?
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
What's all them books?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
But maybe just for awhile --
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Why'd you live there?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Who did you kill?
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
Well, I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Hey Karl, you off work?
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
You want to go with me?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
Oh, jackin' off?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
A boy or girl?
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Yeah.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Huh?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
A blister shore can hurt.
I'm ye boy.
Karl, you up?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Do they know about you?
Yeah.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Do you have family here?
Yes sir.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
What about me?
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
Where will he go?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
What'll it be, Auggie?
And what about for you?
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
How'd you get started?
It's kind of overwhelming.
Hey, man, good to see you.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
I told her she was going to meet her father.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
She looks just like you.
Still, you can't just write her off.
And you're giving it to me?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
A little. Not much.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
It'll never be finished.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I just want to know where he is.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
And have you mended them?
Hi there, little brother.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Well, if you put it that way...
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
That's where the what comes in.
Yeah, that's right.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Eight-thirty.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Where did you get that thing?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
And?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Thanks. 
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
I don't know.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Lettuce and tomato?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
You don't believe in God anymore.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
I did.  Boy.
You said three minutes.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
Well...
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Can I say something, here?
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Improved...how?
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
No --- how does it go?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
We're not?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But suppose it doesn't?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
You've flipped your wig!
I think they got me.
You don't see any blood?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
Blow where?
How can we?  We're broke.
Me?  After Sugar?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
With ME?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
I'll say there is!
Joe -
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Good night, Sugar.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
I'm a very sick girl.
I'm not that sick.
You all right?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
We better have a drink first.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Not you, Sugar.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
No!
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Brand new.
What's wrong with us?
We could dye our hair.
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
I don't care.
I don't like no witnesses.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
And you'll be in all evening?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You don't say?
Brains aren't everything.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Happy days.
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Your face is familiar.
Your view of what?
How's the stock market?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
You collect shells?
Would you mind moving along, please?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Guess!
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
I seem to be out of gas.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Look at all that silverware.
Where's your shell collection?
Complete washout.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
I don't want to bore you.
I never knew it could be like this.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
What'll it be, sir?
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know what I love about all this?
It was such a long time ago.
Say something. Please.
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Hey.
Seeing you again....
That was a long time ago.
So, what’s your point?
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
You’re not even listening.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Mission accomplished.
Mmm.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they’re naked.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Six thousand, right?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
You quitting?
What?
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
It’s hard to explain.
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
You have had girlfriends?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Hi.
I should go.
Oh, no. He told you.
Hey, Sal.
You pawned it.
You want I nut him in the boat?
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
What is it you do again?
That does it...
And you say all them people is dead now?
Here it is, right here.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
What about Sounder?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
But, Charlie --
David Lee...
You learnin' anything at that school?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
From Miss Johnson --
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
What's your daddy's name?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
What's in there, David!?
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
You got two shirts on?
'Bye, Mama...
What is it, David Lee?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
So when I left, she gave me these books.
What's wrong, Nathan?
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
Come, I'll take you home.
Hello, David...
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
How's the weather out there?
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
I just got out here!
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Fuckin' a right.
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
What is this?
-no Cheesy Poofs.
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Come on, just get to the message board!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Cartman?!
Mph rmph rm!!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
The N word?
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
What was that word, young man!?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Mph rmph rm!
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
What's that?
Guess.
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
That's gonna take a long time!
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
How can they do this?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
What if I just left?
Ow, you're hurting me!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Yeah!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
NAZIS!!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
What is it?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Getting drunk is no solution.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Excuse me?
Well I appreciate that.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
So, are you on for the next one?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Idiot...
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
It's getting hard to breathe...
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
OK...it's open.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Everyone just stay put.
I can't let you do that.
You're ready for the real thing?
Do you want some advice?
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
Oh my God.  What happened?
Take this flare.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
You have orange whips?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Where'd you get this ball?
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
Son?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
How's that?
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Junior.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
Nice set-up.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Leave him alone!
Yeah.
Get that outta your mouth!
What's your specialty?
Do you know where they're taking him?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
This is a vicious cycle.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Do I want you?
Why were you suspended?
What's plan B?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
Do you talk with your mom?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
Can I come with you?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Sez you!
Lips still for sale?
Very good, busyboy.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
Get out of there!
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
They told me about sixty hours.
Direction's east coming!
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Norman, please!  Don't!
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
They pressurize us with helium.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
What for?
I see it.
It's not sucking, sir.
Nothing, sir.
I did.
Ted?  Captain?
You don't know that.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
What is that?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forget the sub.
It's not worth the risk.
You fixed my suit?
Still clear?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
None of this was here before.
You don't believe me.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
Not believing you.
What is it, Norman?
It's getting cold.
Are you manifesting them?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
He can't manifest.
You're lying --
That's when you went in the sphere.
You're insane.
Yes.
Shut up, Beth --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Beth!
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
Then where's it coming from?
You hear that?
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
For who?  The fish?
Just in time, too.
What?
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
How are you feeling, Norman?
Don't be defensive.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
Nice work, Norman.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
Norman?
Getting anywhere with those?
You don't remember that?
She's cracking, Norman.
Missed.
C'mon, Norman!
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
There is one possibility.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
What'd you say?
Norman Johnson.
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Try this one.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
I'll get the information.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
What is it?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
The Kiber Crystal.
Of course, where you been kid?
You're Starkiller?
Have you been checked out?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
There are only three or four left.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
I found it... It's just not there.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Well, I practice a lot...
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Watch it!  Move back.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Are you safe?
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
I don't believe it !
Are you alright ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Profile's wrong... there.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
So ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Zander, what are you doing ?
Good for you.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
None at all... We won.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You're late.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
You talk to Carl ?
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
C'mon...
You used to dance...
What frequency ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Let's go.
Can you walk ?
All dead except one, sir.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Who is...'V'ger'...?
<U>Why</U>?!
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
What does that mean?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Departure angle on viewer.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
Programming ready?
<U>Computer off</U>!
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Viewer ahead.
Hold station...!
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
We're losing the pattern...!
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Evening, Annie.
Cal...
Nope.
You bringing your new friend?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
I want to rent this one.
I...
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
That: in an act of...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
Goodbye.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
I <u>can</u>?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
No, I don't...
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Hello.
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Thank you.
Later on.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
...yes.
That's right...
Where you going?
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
How's your star?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
Pelting down out there.
What am I gonna do?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
I wasn't doing business.
He works on the movie.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
He's on the ph...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Fourteen year old girls.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
Mornin, sister.
What else?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Are you Okay?
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
You do...?
You guys had better leave us a...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Izzat so?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
No.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
I want you to hear this.
I love Jewish men.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
You can't do what?
...I can't do it, Wally...
...I...
...I know...I know...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Kiss my ass.
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
What's in the case?
Mmmm.  You have children?
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
Who's White...?
He saw the accident...?
He saw the girl in the car...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
Not now.
I...?
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
We're out of money.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
I can't.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
Then you're finished in show business.
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
How do they know that, you told them?
How do you know you saw it?
You cool the broad out?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
We got the permit.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Wally...?
I want them thrown in jail.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
It just slipped out.
I'm gonna call him.
Well, not exactly s...
So why are you asking me?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
I could help with the debate.
You don't like his friends.
This'll work, huh?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
What if he's kidnapped?
That doesn't bother me.
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You know, this horse smells really bad.
But you told us to starve.
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Queen of diamonds.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Where Ben?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Which part of no don't you understand?
Planning on getting --
Something's up wi...
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
Me too.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
What happens next?
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
We don't have any coffee.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I have a snoop.
So why did y...
However many.  It's not enough.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
I'm sorry, I just...
Jackie?
I don't, but...
Small world.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
She's devastated.
And you said...?
Can I look at the pictures?
It's the same choice you made.
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Why didn't I?
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
They're my kids.
I needed some time away.
Can we go sit somewhere?
Restless.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Why was he on Death Row?
This is definitely better.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
We're not ready.
Don't even joke about that!
Twinkeys!
We did the same thing last year also.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
But what kind of pull did you have?
I dunno.
Get the hell outta here!
OK.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
It's over there.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
OK.
I dunno...
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
Can I see what you have so far?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
I said I'll lead.
What are we going to do!
Forget about it.
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Well?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
What's happening at the waterfront?
Agreed--let's move it.
Are we adrift--
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
So what?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Go back to sleep, baby.
Does the threat board show anything?
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Yes, sir.
Why do you think I ask?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I don't think so, sir.
Where, sir?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Go on, Major.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Yes?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
War.
Check.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Roger.
Primary arming switch.
What does it look like?
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Check target approach.
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
What happened?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Who's that?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Can I have some?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
That was really great.
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Responsibility, progress.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
I'd get bored.
Go!
Fuck it!
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
What she doin' in the van, man?
She's dead?
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Yeah.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Come on man.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Buff.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
No, but I heard it was great.
Yeah, we're all above that.
You make videos?
You could do it.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Will you stand up for me?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Yes.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
I'd love to read that.
It's coming along.
Two-fifty.
Can you tell me what happened?
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
They let you out?
This is my home.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
Please?
Oh! Trim it!
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Your sure as hell right about that.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Okay, what would you have done.
How?
So what do you wanna do?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Mm-hm.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Hey, Pony.
Yeah.
Really?
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Look Pakeesa...
Pony, oh my god!
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
So? What's L.A. like?
Yeah?
No, she was just sitting there?!
You do not!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Alright, alright already.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I'm moving.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Is that Jeff?
You know, my mom has this saying.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Your manager?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Could you give me a ride?
Fuck.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
Holy shit.
Another sex dream?
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Diane?  Diane!
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
Oh no...
Yeah, hold on.
You want us to help you pick up?
Screw Lucy!
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
All of you!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
My best friend got pregnant.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
It's from hunger.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
I was afraid of that.
Good.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Who's Norma?
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
May I say you smell real special.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Hello, Betty.
Hers.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Just a minute, you!
Are you or aren't you?
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
I wrote that with my heart.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
What month?
I want you to do this work.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
There sure is.
What scene?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
They've come for my car.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
The other guests?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Go away.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Did she read the script?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
He must be quite a guy.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
That's a lie!  They still want me!
That's what I told them.
What doctor?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
What is the scene? Where am I?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
Why did she have to show up now?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
This is my favourite place in the city.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
Let me kiss you.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
She said it wouldn't last.
I don't love you any more.
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
Why should I believe you?
Nurse! Nurse!
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
What about my proposal?
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Can I give you a lift?
Someone's chasing him.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
What are you making:
Where is Earth?
There isn't any.
I'd rather not talk about it.
She did that deliberately.
How'd you do that?
No thanks. You go on.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Balefire on you, Selena!
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
That was meant for me!
Who are you ?
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Where is inner space?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
You're going to take me back?
Yes, mustn't stop.
Goodbye...
What?
What are you talkin' about?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You...um...you never got married?
I just can't stand this.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Me??
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Do you really know Superman?
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
How many sugars?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Wipe 'em out?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
Is this blackmail?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Can you do that?
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
What about you?
Why do I have to do this?
Ricky?  Where...what...
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
How would you know?
I can't see anything.
53.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Actually, yes.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Where were you?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
. . . Superman?. . . . .
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
DELETE IN CUTTING
Where?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
You are master of all you survey.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
General --- ?
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
They make my eyes itch.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
Is he for real?
I think there's an angle.
But he's never there.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
What was that about?
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
You think he'll find us.
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
A hot story, huh?
Your bookie?
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Know what?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
This??
So I've noticed.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Damn!  This will get him.
See?
Mr. Romance...
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
No news is not good news. Y'know
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
Then -
Two.
It's a ...baby.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Who...who...
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
It must feel great.
How old are you?
Can you really see through anything?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
I...uh...
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
I gave him steady employment --
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Sort of.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
We're...not together.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
So there were others?
Then...when did she get better?
I...don't think so.
Alison.
I can help you.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Yes.
They can look forward to that.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
What do you mean?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
You heard what Abbott said?
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
So do you like your new room?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Should I keep reading?
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
I don't want you to lie.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
When?
Yes.
I'm in a car wash.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
We do.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
No.
Yes.
You are?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
There wasn't time?
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
What are you up to, Nicole?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
She'll move away.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Is it news to you?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Susie, I'm sorry if---
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
Hello, Harry.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
He means that much to you...?
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Sidney, I told you -
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
Could this be that boy?
Bribing me again?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
I don't think so.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Back?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
But...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Why me...?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Torque wrench please.
Pain causes it?
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
I'll deal with the police.
We don't have much time.
No!
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You look like handmade shit.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
I must be destroyed.
It's finally over.
Are you afraid?
On Furtwängler.
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I'm very sorry.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Where you from, David?
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
You live here, in Berlin?
What's in those files?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I made no deal!
Why were they going to arrest you?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Who?
How?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
What telegram?
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
I'm sorry.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
How can I know such a thing?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Major.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yes, you remember.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
I've remembered something else...
One of your people told me.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
And ask him about his private life.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
You were in insurance before the war.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
And you're from the future too?
There's so much...
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
I'm sure.
You'll learn.
Good field-dressing.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Thanks a lot.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Hot dogs?
He'll find us, won't he?
And so you feel nothing.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
What are you doing?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Give me the short version.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I could fight you on this.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I'm so sorry.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Alright... okay...
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
There's got to be a flashlight.
Home.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
I'll give you a boost.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
There's a ladder here.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Never did catch your name.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Do you mind if I sit?
No!  I'm sick of this...
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
What did you say?
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
What?
Who is it?
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
I redecorated.  What about you?
You need anything?
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Will you?
It doesn't matter...
It's them.  They did this.
How did those... ?
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Oh... it's a game.
Physical?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Get rid of them.
Drive in.
Where?
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Hm?
Dinner's in the oven.
Is everything alright?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
How concerned should I be?
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
And what kind of sleeper?
Luke, can I talk to you?
Well, this lot is full!
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
Nell --
Are you working with her?
You don't believe in the paranormal.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
Sorry.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
And then what happened?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
This is where we're going?
When do we take the tests?
Get a blanket!
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
What do you want?
Why do you need a chain like that?
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
What did it cost?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Jeez.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
Good night, Theo.
Theo... Did you?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Are you sure?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
It's not a compliment.
Anything but Japanese.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian?
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
You think I'm staying?
Fuck you.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I didn't expect anyone.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
What more is there.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
That was one of them?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
I've been wondering something.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Sort a few things out.
How d'you mean?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Ashamed.
Modelling.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
It didn't discourage you, though.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
How far?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
Yeah, I guess you are.
It was you.  Downtown.
Where is he now?
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
What d'you mean, any happier?
What?
How'd you get in here.
He's expecting you?
You've made it ... brighter.
Is he here?
What.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
...Yes?
...You don't like the music out there?
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
...I stank, didn't I?
...No, please.
...Mm.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
Please, Ed.
Rye.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Taking it seriously.
I don't work here. My wife does.
Yeah.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Jesus...
...You ever wonder about it?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Yes, sir.
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Forget it!
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
The body?
We need light in here, stat.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
What happened?!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
Curious.  There's something missing.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
What's that?
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
What do you do?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
This room sucks.
I don't want to go this way.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
They were yellow!
They've got something.
Argo!  Hobbes!
Oh... my... God!
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
What kind of egg is it?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
What happened?
Genetic damage?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
You smell that?
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
That's correct.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
I have a map.
What's he doing?
Why not?
Sure she would.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
How did it go today?
Where have you been?
It'd be an adventure.
What're you doing down here?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
What's the hurry?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
How are you, Mother?
Well, thank you for your help.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
How's it going, Truman?
Good.  Good.
Poopy day?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
I'm looking for him.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
Negotiating with whom?
What?
What do you think?
That would be my guess.
Had you.
Why?
They were the ones that put us together.
You're... quitting?
I wake you?
It's like jelly.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
What kind of infection?
You said you weren't coming?
What did you find?
And you've never seen anything like that?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
And where are they going with it?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
What are you doing?
I have. I did. It's done.
On whose orders?
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
What is it?
You're lying.
Let me out. Stop the car.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Miriam...
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Nothing.
...give a kiss to Edward.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
Agent Novak?
What happened?
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
Agent Cole.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
She changed the codes.
When did he lapse into the coma?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Is she alright?
Agent Novak.
That's a secret.
How is she?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Thank you.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
Why?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Seemed like a good idea.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I wish I knew.
Wer ist da?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
...you know.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
How do you know?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
That's his headache.
...quarrel?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
How will I know you?
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
You a friend of Lime's?
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
What the devil?
This is where he vanished.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Win what?
Do you know his number?
You do!
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
What's that?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
I want to talk to you.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
What do you want me to do?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
...were of you.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Could he have been at all conscious?
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Harry...
That's all you meant?
What else did he tell you?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Passport, please.
Where are you staying?
Excuse me.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Bonjour.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Richard - I saw a fin!
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
What about Moliere?
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Too far?
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
You think?! Based on what?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
You will.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Is he a Nazi?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
I want to learn to read it.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Why should I submit?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
I didn't realize you cared.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
You wouldn't announce it?
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Is it okay if I record this?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Those aren't Jews.
Who? How would I know him?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
How do you reconcile the two?
I always won.
I thought you hated Torah.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
Don't tell me what I --
Do you feel you're making progress here?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
What about chicken?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Who knows what that is?
Which one were you aiming at?
This will be a different kind of device.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
That's all we've got left.
Not too fast.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
You missed on purpose.
And what did you do?
You can't say that....
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Do you think I...
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
What do you mean?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
You're going to live here permanently?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
You're leaving?
What's happened??
Where did you two meet?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
The Mamma's there too.
Is it a poem?
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
What else is there?
Because you'd laugh.
... Not yet.
How did it happen?
Ten thousand.
Roberto?  How long?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Is he here?
... What's your name again?
And where did you say you were from?
What's with the voice?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Why?
You're the best, Enzo!
That's good.
It's okay.
... Everything.
What?
No!  I would never cheat you.
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques, you set a world record.
So have I.  ... Hello?
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
You'll try again tomorrow?
Jacques...?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
... And the new stereo.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
Who... Who is that?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
I'll go see how he's doing.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
We do!
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
They don't say it to me.
Where's that man?
Sure!
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
He will be waiting...
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Oh, that's so interesting!
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
To the eye? Like other men.
What are you getting at?
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Who is he?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Kiki?
We stood here once before.
That’s right.
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Mr Lombard...
I’m really sorry you were not called...
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I don’t.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
Where is that?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
The word for those things is croissants.
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
What...?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
How much of a hurry are you in?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Where?
Where are we?
Where are the kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
How many of you scumbags are here?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Where is it?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
May I...?
What if it is?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
Any friends?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Vous êtes Français?
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
You seem very sure about that.
Trying to say something, Martin?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
It’s wet. Will this do?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
Gluck.
Why did you kill him?
Are they still operative?
Mossad?
What do you mean?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I thought you were an archer?
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
We must sound the retreat!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
Quick -- hide in here...
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
Get them out of here!
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
So how would you put it?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
Supposing she's an assassin?
... as always, majesty...
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Wait, wait...
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Prepare these as battering-rams!
We... won?!
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
My... visions...
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
They won't come anyway.
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Yes I am.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
You think you are ready now?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
Is that bad?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Someone you know?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
And how's Yurek?
Let me see this.
Funny time to say this.
wish I knew you better.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
We're recruiting.
And suppose they take the table away?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
But I want to help, I want to.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
Why didn't you come to me?
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Szpilman.
Careful! Watch his hand.
Which mountains are those dear?
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I worry for you.
You'd have to organise it up here.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
And when is the next lesson?
All right if I look around your lobby?
Which way are the rooms?
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
How much did ya lose?
Then why ain't he dead?
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
I like griftin'.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
I thought you blew all your money.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
You beat him, kid.
You wanta wait for your share?
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
How ya doin'?
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
She coulda killed me last night.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
You doin' anything tonight?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
What does this guy want?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
Well, what did I tell ya?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got the 400 grand yet?
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
You got nothin' on me.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
What about this Rosebreen?
What's your next step, Nick?
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
What?
Mind if I look around?
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
Then what are you hiding?
You hand that over to the police.
How did you ever remember me?
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Your father?
She fell down.
She... she fell over backwards.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Shrapnel!
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Nothing.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Who's is it?
What about Jorgensen?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
Good morning --
I think we may as well sit down.
Have a shot?
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I don't like him.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
That's my business.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
I never had it.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Well, let me do that for you.
Thanks, and goodbye.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Dorothy!  Is she here?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
I've never heard about you.
You got types?
Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I never saw that before.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Sit down!
Why don't you?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Nick!
Wynant's body?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Why not?
What are you going to do?
Who do you think did it?
Mimi!
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Is that true?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
You his wife?
I'm sorry...  but...
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
What?
They shouldn't have been here.
What are you doing.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
He's not so--
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
You ready?
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about it?
You got no reason to do that!
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
I'm not going to let you kill him.
Then step aside.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
You think?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
They're not going to--
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
They're doing more than slapping.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Where the hell is it!?
If they land--
Think there might be more Iraqis?
A whole lot of nothing.
He's not going to leave us.
Wes might be right about that.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
We can't just leave him.
No.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Epps?
What do we do?
Why haven't they killed us!?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
Which way do we go!?
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Australia.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
He's not slowing.
What is this?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
You ever think about dying?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
At-at-at-at-at.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
So?
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
What do you think?
You down?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
I think he wants something to drink.
Drug evasion with....
HUMMMM.....
I'm not hungry.
You know I don't feel well.
Now?
I haven't done anything.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Are you all right?
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
They're watching us now.
What's going on....what are you doing?
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
What's going on?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
Right now.
I don't know.
What was that....
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
No...no you're wrong.
Yes
Yes.
They're not here.
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Only once, at Redstone.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Ex-girlfriend?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Keep talking.
Yeah, another round thing.
Which one's which?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
You got it.
C4, plastic explosive.
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
You okay?
No... No more killing.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
You don't fish.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
What was it this time?
Mike...
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Captain...
Sir...
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
What did you talk about?
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
And harems ... ?
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Yes, Baron.
I would start with cocktails.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
Who?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Disappointed?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Monescu!
Right.
The fourteenth of May.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Two fifty-three, five--
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Now, Lily--
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
But, Lily--
Yes...?
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Naturally I did.
Make it out to cash!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
I'll be delighted.
Then a little nap--
Good night. 
Like that!
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Mariette!
It could have been marvelous ...
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
To me he seems rather nervous.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
There's a satellite call for you.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
I make my own luck.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Is this in any way unclear?
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
The boats are all going.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
Is your stateroom alright?
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Oh--a hundred times--
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Where'd you get it?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
No gentleman would do that.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were one of my friends.
Yes--are you?
You've got lipstick all over you.
There's soft music--
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
This is Mr.--er--
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Isn't she attractive?
Sooner it you like.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Who with?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
Well, I'll be--!!!
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
Nix, the law!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
My change.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
About sixteen hundred.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
How about you?
I'll go with you.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
That's me!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
Well, he has a straw hat--
Get that out of your trunk.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
How much did you lose?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Yes, Yes!
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
There you are, sir.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
A peace officer... Impressive man
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
I'm retired.
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Forget it.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
On three?  You call it.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
How you feeling, Doc?
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Very instructive
Satisfied?
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Don't touch me!
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
What is it?
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Just answer.
Doesn't suit you.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
And I don't even know your full name.
I hate Sadie.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
What can I get you?
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Really?  You sure?
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
'Least you admit it.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Yeah?
How you doin', boy?
Get down, boy.
I just got it fixed.
That a fact?
We should get moving.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Virgil?
What about all these saloons?
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
...And what's that, my dear?
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Q! How are you?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Wait a minute -
Don't you think you're overreacting?
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Do you feel better now?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
... Shoelaces?
Can you arrange a meeting?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Where to now, Jimbo?
They point, I shoot.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
- Shut up!
Do I have to do everything around here?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Not a lot of difference.
What the hell does that do?
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
That was too close.
Is the helicopter ready?
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
What did your wife get her?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Why don't you come in for a while?
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Who is it?
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I'm going back home with Harry.
What is that?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Well, you just have to move further out.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Your feet are cold.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Since this morning.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
What's the problem here?
You invited me.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Where is Skip?
Wow!  Cool!
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Woody!  Buzz!
Which one can I open first?
We're almost there.
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Can!
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Great!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
What?
MOM!!  MOM!!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
There.
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Woody!  Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll put your clothes here.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
He made that. In his off hours.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
You're only a young thing.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Stop it!
Finn ...
Surely she is older?
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
Did you do this?
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
What?  What is it?
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
How much do I pay him?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Did you get it?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
What's up?
How's David?
Helena --
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Helena --
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Live with your parents?
Do you work?
You do?  What else you do?
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
That's a big word for a fisherman.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
What do we do?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
What?
Well, I've not brought them.
I'll be right after you.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Sorry.
Jesus.
I don't see why not.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
What? Steady like?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What happened?
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
Following the game at all?
You take the test?
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Exactly.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Who wrote it?
The park?
Who wrote it?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Say something, Mark, say something --
Cut it out.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
That's tough.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
Excellent.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Great.
Sounds great, Swanney.
It's the great outdoors.
How's it going with Gail?
How long is it?
Six weeks and no sex?
What do you see as your main strengths?
Qual se tu?
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
Admit it. We're lost.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Sulu, what are you doing?
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Not General Korrd.
I do not often think of the past.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Is it possible?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock.
Spock... don't.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
What are you doing?
You are mad!
About the ship...


I don't understand...
Sybok.
You did break in.
Are you embezzling?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
My dinner.
Want one?
How's it going upstairs?
Did you say Group 7 access?
Flynn!
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Beautiful!
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
That all you can say?
Oh. Anything else?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
User requests are what computers are for.
Yes?
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
What's that?
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
What about our friend - Sark?
There's another beam!
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Watch it!
Hey... !
So...how's the world of serious science?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
A User?
Wait...I need that...
The Users...you really think they're still there?
You think we can make it there?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
My quarters.
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
You bitch.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Where are you going?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
What's this for?
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Fourteen, Harry.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
What's the plan?
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
He's got it.
So, it was your first time.
My husband is a good man.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
I'm late.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
They said you had to run out.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
And you agreed?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Natasha?
Are we going to die?
Do you still love me?
Oh shit.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Yeeaoowww!!
Boris and Doris?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
What do you want me to do?
Who is this woman?
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Gotten your mail yet?
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
The forager's back.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Bye-bye.
Thanks a lot.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Four hundred bucks.
You know when you sat behind me?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
"Heroes For Sale"?
Who?
Who and what is a Drexl?
You have a pimp?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Yes.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
I do.
Where you goin', honey?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
I think what you did was...
I think what you did...
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
What?
You'd really do that?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Clarence?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
What?
No. No, you don't.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Don't you?
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I've seen him.
What are you talkin' about?
On their honeymoon.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
You and Robin moved?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Preach on, Big D.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Yes.
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
Well?
Him?  You saw that man?
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
What kind of information?
Do you know why you're here, James.
A jail?  Prison?
You're afraid of germs?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
They're keeping an eye on me.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
The guy was a total fruitcake.
You smell so good.
See -- you can drive after all!
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
The gun! ... I lost it
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
What does this mean to you?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
Why are we doing this?
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
Germs?!
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
What are you talking about???
Excuse me -- what did you say?
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
Uh, that message...me?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
What...virus?
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
That a fact?
Nothing.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
How much time?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
We ain't got no Beck's.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
What's the matter?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Accident.
That a fact?
Thank you, John.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Least you can leave.
Where you coming from?
You've been around.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
Have you ever been there before?
Take me with you.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
If you want.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Let's do it here.
To get my car.
What?
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
John!
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I'm a solid man.
Where you headed?
Would you?
Why would I kill her?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
What should I do?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
You love her, but you hate her?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Two-hundred dollars.
I asked you a question.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Now, what's this?
Nooo!
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
No police.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
I wasn't doing anything.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Wait a second--
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Next time you'll do just fine.
Shhh! Liar.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
Got any requests?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Will he be back soon?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
Accident.
Hey.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
No charge.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Got any cold soda?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
I like that about me, beautiful.
Jesus.
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I wanted to talk.
What about us?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace ... Grace?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
I don't know about that?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
And I love you too.
The old lady?
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
I want to stay.
Yes?
Proceed.
Is Jeremy okay?
Okay.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
When was the last time I wore pink?
Megan?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Would you like to try going--
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
You've never been sick?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Quick.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
No Jeremy.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
You like sports?
He doesn't look very threatening.
Was your family traveling with you?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
...I got a present for you.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Scouting?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Books. He's my biographer.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
Mmmm pistols.
Hit your finger, huh?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
They really got all that money, them whores?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
The... Duck of Death.
Duke.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
Ned's share?
Who killed him?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
Then... what?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Maybe I ain't.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Finish him, Ned.
Better re-load it.
When we gonna double back?
Wha... what f-for?
You... gonna take... the money?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
He musta been movin' right along.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
HEY, KID.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Shit.
No.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Worms was comin' out.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
What is it, son?
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Did you... did you... ?
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Jesus.  You done this before?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Yeah.
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Keyser Soze
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
I love you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
This is not right.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
What the hell do you want?
You watch your mouth.
What if I
Ready?
Let's say for example -
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
You set up the line-up.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
We're on vacation.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
I don't know about that.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
Edie...
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
He was accused of jury tampering.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
How is that?
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
No further questions.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Just now...
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
I do.  Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Yes.
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Thank you ...
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Listen to me, fella...
Galvin, look, many years ago...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
What happened...?
Why don't you get some rest?
Joe...  Joe...
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
... now who is that ...?
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
That's right.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Another, Frank . . . ?
Well, well, well.  Huh?
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
You don't have to do it for a living.
How long have you been back?
How often does this happen?
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
You.
What do you want to know?
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Will you have dinner with me?
Tomorrow night? Well --
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Well?
Come here.
Can't you see?
But why? Why here?
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Do you remember where you were?
Please drink your coffee.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Would you like some coffee?
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
No.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
How can you be sure?
Why?
Where?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
How do you know?
There's a name on the gravestone.
What else?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
Why?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Her car is gone.
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
How do you know? Personal experience?
I know. Everybody tells me.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Well?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
I've told you enough.
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Yes! That's it!
Well...
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
Can't do what?
I said how's it going?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
This is pathetic.
What did you say?
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Go home!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Wait!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
How do you figure?
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Fuck you Boyd!
What?
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
That's one idea.
Are you solid with that?
I won't do it.
If anything ever happens to me...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
My god.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
What is it?
She's not here.
Yup.
That's right.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
You said that Boyd.
What kind of words?
What?
Regarding what?
Just do it.
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
Nope.
Take Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
Caterer?
Why did you forget the tent check?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
He's a great chef.
Seating problems.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
What okay?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
This is our honeymoon.
Yeah. Sure.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
What are you talking about?
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
I'm getting married...
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
The first day.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Pup corn?
Yeah?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
The post-Vegas Man.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I'll come to you tonight.
Stop this, stop this.
Where's the camera?
Take me there.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Was that difficult to get?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
Come down here, you scamp.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
You must think I'm mad.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
You believe me, don't you?
Me?
Why the bad temper?
So, Ramona!
You see how much you like her?
Me, rich? Come on!
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Well... is it so urgent?
What do you know about me?
Is she coming back?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Ask the priest, miss.
What happened to me?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
In English, please.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
This better not be a wild goose chase.
What the hell happened?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Go to hell.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
What happened when he was 17?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Relax. I know what you meant.
What did you do to those people?
You know I am.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
You're not capable of it.
Then shoot him already.
Where's John?
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
What if he's busy tonight?
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...

Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Why do they go to War?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
How much...?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What do you want the kid to say?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Remember the Maine...
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
They got to have something that we want.
What do we have that they want?

Wake up.
No, I didn't think so.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?

...mmm.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Sell?
That's great Dad.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Your words, not mine...
Another cup of coffee?
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
I don't know anything!
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
What about hard work?
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Hello Bud.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Where is it?
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Can I give her a message?
Tony and China?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Then why do you still like her?
Oh that explains everything.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
He loves you very much.  He just--
Because he was worried about me.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Why is he worried?
These are good.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Your friend saw them.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
That can't feel good.
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
Who?
Who are you?
I've seen you.  From the window.
Tell me.  I can help you.
Your house is so beautiful.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No, I don't.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Why are you here?
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
They're calling me in to work.
Wow.
You are?
Well good.  So you're human.
What is it?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Seance.
Oh...
Okay.  Okay.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Jody he was lying.
How are you?
It's just us now.
Tired?
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Maybe we should just...
Of what?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Get down!  He'll see.
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
What are you...?  No.
The accident...?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
We walked all night...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's too rough.
I think she's starting to suspect something.
That's not what I'm sayi--
Claire...
Adamant.
Do you know it?
I don't believe you.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
With his hands!
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Rowan...
Who is this...?
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Made it...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
I know that you're evil.
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
No!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
What do you see...?
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Why don't you let at do that...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
I'm serious.  You don't -
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
You look a little green.
When aid you get home last night...?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Wow...
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
Which do you think is her best shot...
I heard something like that
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
It doesn't mention 'females only'
Oh, about six years since I graduated
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
What did you do with her?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Tell me about your wife...
then why did you marry her -
What didn't you like about her?
What?
Yes...
Where are you going?
We've got nothing to talk about
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
What happened?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Her husband left her
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Someday, I'll find out.
Who the hell was your father?
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Check this out.  Hurry!
Hurry.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
You'll never believe who's in there.
Get them together.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
Well?
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
The lesson being?
You guys are my parents.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
Finally, some gratitude.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Who exactly ARE you?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
James, what are you doing here?
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
I miss them, too.
You're a peach.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
In what sense?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I guess.
Don't write that part.
Where are we going?
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
You promise you'll finish school?
But who would run the store?
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
I'm warning you.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
In a hurry, are we?
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
How you doing, Artie?
How soon can we get something?
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
Did you try to fight him?
Then what?
You mean he withdrew...
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
It's our job, Gloria.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Will you do me one favor?
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
Oh, Ray... no...
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
This wasn't my idea.
It's those rocks, up there.
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
We have to stick with the plan.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
I don't know.  I want to see you...
I'm running away.
There's nothing for them to get.
Who is it?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
You mean this thing?
Jesus, man... You okay?
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
No.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Aha!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Now, what was that?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Can you fill me in here?
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
Are those just button buttons or...?
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
He's not giving up?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
I've even printed my own currency.
The first.
Easy now.
Dr. Pemberton?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Well?
Willow Ufgood.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
You gotta promise to feed her.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
She said lots of thing.s
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Dada, what's a daikini?
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
You must learn magic.
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
I'm not going in there.
She's hungry.
I'm getting her out of there!
Hey, careful there!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Your hole is healed, then?
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Don't let them hurt you.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
What's your first move?
Who else knows?
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
You have no right to keep us here.
Now what's the problem?
But not a good tired.
How long have I been here?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Your husband's?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Where's the nearest telephone?
But Stoltzfus said...
You know carpentry?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Sure.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
Anybody know about this?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Did you find him?
Good morning.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
God, Fred...
That has no place in this house.
I am not a child.
I will be the judge of that.
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
I wish dawdie was with us.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Ahh!  Ah!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Toto's my dog.
I thought you said she was dead.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Yes, I'm ready now.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
...her face is careworn.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Oh --
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Now you're seeing reason.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh - I'll get it!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
...yes.
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
How about a hippopotamus?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
...free!
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
Yeah.
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
What happened?
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
Dorothy!
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
...Tin Man!
...junk!
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Animals that -- that eat straw?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Well --
Stop that dog!
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
The King pipeline.
We’ve got to get out.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
It’s just a scratch.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
She’ll get over it.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
He was my father.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
...what?
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
So you killed your father.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
I thought you were the one in her business.
Where’s the sub going?!
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
Why?  What's the problem?
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
What's your theory?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
No.  I just wanted you to --
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Damn straight.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
Laurie --
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
What the hell -- ?
They're practically on us . . .
What?
What was he doing?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
So do I.  So do you.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Where's Laurie?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Their real names, please.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I'm terribly sorry.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Adrian.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
Up yours.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
What game is that?
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Like what?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Who are you?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Hey, you're good.
What are you?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Did you do your homework?
Toadies right behind.
What are you doing?
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
This is your standard dart gun.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Are you all right?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Logan, do you see this ring?
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
You designed this yourself?
Frederick Frankenstein?
What was your grandfather's name?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Carlson!
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
And your passport?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Goodbye, darling.
Ready, darling?
What a strange fellow.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
I suppose you're right.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
That's a tough choice.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
What?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
