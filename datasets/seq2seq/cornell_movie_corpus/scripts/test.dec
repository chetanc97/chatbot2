Well, there's someone I think might be --
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I believe we share an art instructor
I was?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Hopefully.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
What?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Never
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
That's what I just said
I thought you hated those people.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
You get the girl.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
You just said
I'm on it
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
An attempted slit.
William would never have gone to a state school.
No fear.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
And why would I do that?
You -- covered in my vomit.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Maybe.
I'm gettin' there
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
BIANCA
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
For. . . ?
You know what I mean
Oh huh
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
I thought you were punishing me.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Hi.
Right.
What?
Good enough.
Just for now.
Yeah.
Absolutely not.
We'll all go crazy...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Excellency, you are right.
The Judgment is ours!
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Look out of that window.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
My horse doesn't work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
God be with us admiral.
Come over here.
Twenty eight.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
What about Oleg?
No, he is here.  Shit...
What's your cut?  How much?
What else do you need?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Can I see your back?
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
It was my decision, not his.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
But Chief?  Over this??
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Vodka tonic.
When?
You ready?
A timer.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
What are you saying?
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
You got any better ideas?
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Better than one.
Raw deal.
So am I.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What do you want?
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright?
That's good.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Don't be late.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
You stuff sausage in it.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Where's Czech girl?
Where is escort service?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Yes.
How long are you planning to stay?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Don't speak Russian!
You said speak Czech!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Sit down!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
I want to hear everything he said.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
He's my collar!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
No. I never did, either.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes, it is.
The antenna has to be replaced.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
She's in the bathroom.
Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
How is gregor?
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Opening pod bay doors.
Hammond.
How about chargin' the battery?
Great, just great.
I ain't tired yet.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Would you guys...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Thank you.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Not likely, convict.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You stay with me...
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Yeah.
Shit.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I'm heading out. How about you?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I guess he got the message...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Jack, are you okay?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Tell me.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Can't complain.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Naw, right here's okay.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
You know exactly where they are!
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
You noticed...
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
I didn't know your size.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
How many points you got left on your license?
So, just how big was this fare?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Thanks for reminding me..
Found it?
Uh... not really.
Crystal.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
What is... Make Love?
Learning language.
All 900.
Apipoussan!
You know women normally change five times more than men.
OK, you can turn around!
I'm so tired...
I want to sleep... forever...
I love you...
You gotta push the little yellow button...
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Recommendations.
Gentlemen?
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Only too well... here you must be parched..
No... not at all.  Where are you?
...I can't wait to be among you.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
I know.
Why the gun?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Mrs. Christian.
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
I'm telling you...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
And they are?
I'll consider it.
Machine.
You betrayed us.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Why don't they come to me?
I'm not so sure about this.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
What did you do with her body?
Easy enough for you.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
That's right.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Never mind how I found you.
Shut up.
I'm asking.
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Good for you.
Max.
How much?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Child pornography.
Twenty-five.
I don't know, where are yours?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Specialty product.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I told you I can't, not yet.
I hope it's nothing serious.
I don't understand, who are... ?
Yes, but...
I don't know.  I think so.
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
No, you may not.
What?
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
We have matching luggage.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
"In her dream"?
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
How did you know that?
No...
She doesn't want me around
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Yeah...I guess.
Me too.
To take a picture.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Krueger is reality.
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
Then we'll find another way.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
All of us.  Right?
Faint.
Mark...
He invited me to his house last night.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
So?
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Somewhere down there?
Right, Skipper.
What???
The frogmen?
Why do you say that?
What????
Under <u>water</u>?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
There's got to be an explanation!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Who with?
What?
Minus three.
Come where?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Obviously.
Thank you.
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Same old shit.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Really.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Shit.
Yeah.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Lawford?
Do what?
Break stuff?
I guess they're stupid.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
It's stupid.
Yes.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Nothing.
I'm not saying that.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
I figured you already heard.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Hi honey.
Mel Gordon.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
Okay. She's fine.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
But not now.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Wade.
How's that?
Yes. Here's your ticket.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
What?
This town sucks.
Jack?
Where... how'd you hear that?
His office. You mean my old office.
In the living room.
Bang!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Who?
What happened?
What about her?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah.
Wade, are you alright?
For what?
I'm sure he's busy.
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
Your father never means to be so...
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
He's busy being dead.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
We don't know that.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Because it is my duty.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Where are we now?
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
They've gotta be joking.
Gravity.
What?
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Excuse me?
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're handling it, sir.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
I might still have a few chips left.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Accelerators down.
You better check it, Unger.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Te...!
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
If that's the way you want it.
That was very well put, Ted.
Compute!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
I think so.
Roger.
Negative.
Go ahead.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Yeah.
All right.  Here.
What?
You're sure?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
That's right.
Certainly.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Randy.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Thank you.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Yeah...
That's right.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Lay off, asshole.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
And that fits?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
At the end of the bar.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
In the other man's rectum.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
We all did.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Ss-ai!
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
We can't let him get away.
Only holds five.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Ss'kya'ta'.
The human?
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Well, thanks, I --
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
...We're coming in.
Let's get these things lit.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Just get back here!
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Yeah.  What?
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
That's right.
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Indeed.
Good morning.
No.
In a harem.
A brothel.
Extremely clever.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Em iram! Em iram!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
What?
Eat
Oh, leave me alone.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
Tell them to go!
No!
Why not? Half the house!
I'm not telling you.
Why?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I can't write it!
It's killing me.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Yes.
But! I'm a married woman!
I was at hand.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Leave him alone!
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Be careful!
Behold!
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
Yes?
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Yes, indeed.
Enchanted, Madame.
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Twenty-six.
Thank you, Sire!
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
How is your financial situation?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
It's a secret.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
Mine?
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
I will, sir.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Yes what?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
German!
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Did you like it, then?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Of course not.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
How could I not?
How could it not, Excellency?
What dead? Who is dead?
How much?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
No! No, it's him!
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
You go fast!
Just let me tell you how it begins.
On the contrary.
A little modesty would suit you better.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Ah - you've heard that?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
About the ballet.
What? Who the devil are you?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
What do you mean - now?
Who is she?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Yes, Doctor.
How is that?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
I thought you were asleep.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Your dead friend Jack?
There is only one bed.
I was awake and he was in my room.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
The zoo?
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
No.
No!
Why on earth do you say that?
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
That's very funny, that is.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Did you see Jack?
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
David.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Shall we?
You ask them.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I heard that.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
I don't know. Come on.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's circling us.
Plan?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
No.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Nurse!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
What do you think?
You must believe me.
How shall I do it?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
No.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like some tea, please.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
You here again? What do you want?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Aw, nerts!
Yes, sir.
Just pure luck!
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
I haven't got it.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Well, you can. You always could.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Good for you. Come on.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Got a handkerchief?
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Yes.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
Where is he now?
Now don't you worry about it.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes?
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Sure, I think it's swell.
There you are.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson—
If he can do it, yes.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
I tell you, I saw them!
Mr. Williams . . .
He was here?
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
It couldn't have been earlier?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
I guess so.
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Swear.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
You are a fine figure of a man.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
She got two of them.
She was European!
Twenty?!
Yep.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
I'm out.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
You ride like a Comanche.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
They gonna rush us?
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Where is Jesse James?
You're right, sir.
What is it?
So?
My little Web did that?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
You can shut up now.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
What do you think?
Don't care.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
They're making him a hero now.
Everything but the boring parts.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Stop it. This is just sad.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
I figured.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
You been with a girl ever?
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
Yes sir.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
I look forward to seeing it.
Sir?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
It is a nice piece of writing.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
I demand action.
In English, Pinkerton.
What is that?
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Nice?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Yes.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Maybe.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You just haven't been looking.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Alright.
Do...what.
No-I can't take the time off work.
I don't want to talk about it.
Everybody has a great body now.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Nice.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
There was no ad in the Times.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Uh huh.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Patrick?
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Negative. Cancel it.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
No, not really.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Why?
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
What?
No. I really don't.
Next Saturday?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Thanks.
No, I guess it's okay.
No, he just hung out there.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
No.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Don.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Marcus?
Where was Marcus?
So who was he with?
I'm not...
I'm hungry
I'm hungry.
Oh well, you know.
Yes, it is.
I can paint anywhere.
Didn't you visit the campus?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
Nothing.
Guilt?
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
It's gonna get cold.
You're just afraid to eat it.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Yes sir.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
What'd they ever do for you?
Is it your dish?
Oh hi.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Skywire.
I do!
Okay. I'm Gary.
...Do I?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Talk about work? Never!
Oh. Yeah.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
You look a little tired.
'Have a look?
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
You do?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Keep looking.
Let's get him in here.
No. Please.
Why's that?
But why would they --?
They'd frame him.
Hmm?
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Let's try #2.
Wait a second. He knows I know.
Uh. Not exactly.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
We won, Austin.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes?
Thanks.
Right away, Exposition.
Be careful.
What?
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Thanks.
Yes Basil?
Why not? It's a question.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
I beg your pardon?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Yes.
Shut up.
Are you crazy?
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Behave!
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
My son?
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
Not me.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Great.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
Well, it's kind of weird.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Black...
... power ...
... preserve...
... love ...
... love ...
Have we met?
Promised? Who promised?
As you see.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
We have met ...
Hmmm ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
After the cold war ...
So am I.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
I'm already married ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
Ring?
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
Why should they think that?
Any ideas?
Is that written in his shoe?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Orders.
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Not for a moment.
You lied.
No idea who. No idea why ...
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Have a look at this.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Still a bit chilly ...
Have you any place in mind?
I see.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
I shall need a small plane.
So you say ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Both, actually.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
Ugh ...
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
I'm very happy for you two.
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Yes, sir, I am.
I've tried to change her mind.
Keep me informed.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
C'mere.
Good...
C'mon, I knew it was you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
You know your father enjoys his company.
Quiet, Mother.
I hope those guys are all right.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Screw that.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Ha, ha, ha.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
No sob story is going to change my mind.
The phone made me do it!
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Be gentle.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
We're gonna be okay, man...
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
He's alive.
Who asked you?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
What, are you kidding? By myself?
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
You're selling dad's boat?
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Saw what?
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
-- What are you doing here?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
What are we going to do about this?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
You look great.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
How's it going?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Then why did you quit?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Who's doing this?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
What are you listening to?
And the putty around the door?
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Yeah.
Like it never happened...
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
It's in my blood, Willy.
I was ahead of my time.
I'm busy.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
He's got piano lessons.
He's going to be a fireman.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
You treated me like shit.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Tell him about me, Shadow?
And old ladies?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
No Marty, I don't.
Investigator...
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Who?
Yes.
Me?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
I forgive you.
All right, cop. I want my money.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
Are you sure?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
You've really got a problem.
I'm on it.
Please.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
How much?
And this is Manray.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
And I'm the feet.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We was coming to see you.
How you sound?
No costume.  No blackface.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Exactly!
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
I want to speak with you.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Where do you go from here?
I didn't mean that, in life.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Do you know how you will use him?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
Break a leg.
Everybody shut up.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
I thought it was appropiate.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
He's just playing big brother.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
He, I'm Mona.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
What you did is dead wrong.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
I don't believe it.
It looks delicious.
I'll be right over.
Where is he?
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Soon.
I just turned twenty.
What's a Negro.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
What do you mean?
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
She hates dem.
I thought you got rid of...
...no, she didn't...
...I heard different, thought that was...
Just a little something' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Never read a book in my whole life.
And what?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
You can go now.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
What is your uncle's name?
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
I have acted as I think fit.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
And his baggage?
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
As you please.
Certain?
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Have you not a man whom you value?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
Agreed.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
When is he to go?
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
I see.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
And he doesn't care about me?
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
We don't know. West is dead.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
I'm not telling you what happened.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
I'm serious --
Do what?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Would you have believed me?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
You hated West more than any of us.
That's exactly what he says about you.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Put it down!
But you didn't.
Mr. Hardy?
No. I said Dunbar.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Who killed Pike?
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's preposterous --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
What point?
I lied. Wait for it...
I don't think that has anything to do with --
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Good idea.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
You wanted to get the truth.
Get in.
Isn't this how your story goes?
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
The faggot speaks.
Oh, you remember now --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
We're not going anywhere.
No --
We know.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Why?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
No, I understand.
You were talking about your wedding.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
The Old Lady by the swamp.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I will.
Dad?
Can we talk?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
It would kill you, huh?
How what happens?
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
I'm robbing this place.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Really! That's wonderful.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
There's over eighty thousand here.
What are you doing here?
No I haven't.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
You're asking for my documents?
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Oh nothing.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
You can stay tonight.
Good night.
He wants money.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
You don't understand anything.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
You don't want to talk about it.
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
So now you hate all women?
You didn't mind too much.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
Get out.
No.
Not really. Maybe a little.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Laugh it up.
I'm trying to quit.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
It's alright.
No. I think I better just go.
Please. Why not?
It's not mine either.
Maybe you will find out.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Thanks.
Cash.
Just wanted to see.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
I got others.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
You sayin' you'll do what?
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Well I don't...
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Whose doin' is that?
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
I ain't in a hurry.
I'm here with you.
I tried.
Nothin'.
By myself?
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
You feelin' sick?
Yeah, I know.
Holy shit!
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Got in a little accident.
The hell are you talkin' about?
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Home.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Get rid of it.
Charlie...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Number five with a bullet.
Hey, when in Rome --
Cool?
What does Charlie mean?
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Where would you look for the mafia?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Why weren't you at the platform?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Sure.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Gaiijin.
I want to yank Kobo.
Big enough.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Kampai.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I don't know.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
A wife.  She left.
Me too.
I need someone to translate for me.
Who am I supposed to be?
Tell them I'm not.
The cheese...
Not in that company.
What?
Why me?
He killed a police officer.
Right.
Do you know what this is?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I'll pay you.
You certainly have a nice place here.
Then go get him.
Also extraordinary things.
You're just all so... so different.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
You didn't like her!?
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
I know all that.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Prosit.
I like you too.
Four years.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
Huh huh.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Too old.
Yes?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Does it eat?
Sorry.
I work alone.
Yeah.
You did?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
What?
What's a long time?
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
No, I don't.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Thirteen.
Discreetly.
Sorry.
How do you know I'm not?
I'm tired of this.
A tortoise.  What's that?
Of course.
Pris.
Hi.
Is that why you're still here?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Are you French?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, you get out of here.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
You're lost?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
I know a short-cut.
Why doesn't it never work out?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Sure.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Okay.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
What for?
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Yes, ma'am!
Sorry!
I told you I've never driven before!
Sure.
So, what are you seeing?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
And don't be so obvious!
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Thanks.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Your mom made that all by herself.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
I'm not wearing his pants.
I LOVE THIS!!
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Of what?
The sky!!!
Up there!!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Good!
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll be all right.
Yes, ma'am.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Yes, dear!
All our friends...
If I...you know...
You bet.
I don't believe it!
We do?
Excuse me.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Always good advice.
Eve?!
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
You're goddamn right I am!
Coward!
Give it back to him.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
It must be great.
Okay.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Yeah.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Jeffrey nothing.
Nobody.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Same here.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Don? Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Sometimes I think I do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Mommy's here.
You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
If you want to.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Speak to me Fucker.
What?
Mom.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
No. No thank you.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Uh-uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Terrible boring.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
No.
Okay. Great!
No Jeffrey!!
Okay.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Let's do him right here.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Yes.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
We're here brother.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
We... met them last night.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Fuck!
Aye.
Shut it. It's Ma.
He got beat up by a girl.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Aye.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
It is your corrupt we claim.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Rule of thumb?
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Can she I.D. them?
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
How do you figure?
Rocco!
Where's my cat?
You... oh god, why?
You killed my... my...
Pee...Per...Man.
The fat man.
No way they could have seen it?
Sweet-n-low!
Who were the victims?
I...
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
You sure you killed them?
What the fuck do you mean?
Y-Yes my son.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Right. The blond guy.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
No. This is he.
Would they do that?
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
What do you think the cops have?
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Eight dollars.
You think we're going to be chased?
Where's the other stocker?
We know there's another stocker.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What do you think?
Because my mom gets the bill.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
It's not a plan. It's just --
On the left.
No kidding.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Where was it parked?
You were asleep.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
You don't know how to hotwire.
Shut up!
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Right now.
Bob!
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Roger.
It's going back down.
Nobody move!
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, Kumar.
I'll see you there.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Pretty much everything.
We're not sure.
How?
Dignan, I --
Scale the --
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Grammar.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
No. Bob did.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
No, I don't mind.
Why do you say that?
No. I wasn't adopted.
It was stupid.
No.
God, yes. Like silk.
I hear you're a good thief.
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Is that Buckethead?
That's your friend Anthony?
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
True.
You're the faggot.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
That never would of --
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
I can't believe you said that.
I told you he's crazy.
Maybe she turned.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
My brother's in jail.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Watch me.
Anthony. Bad news.
I didn't have any choice.
That's OK.
Yeah?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Run. Run. Let's go.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Here we go.
Now!
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Yes.
Who? Applejack?
No, my friend knows her.
You Hoto?
Good to know you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
One last push. One.
I want to know about Treadstone.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Did he say anything to you?
Okay... 
I speak English.
Yes...
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
I don't know who that is.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
-- take the back -- get another car --
Conklin up front.
I worry when you get like this.
There must be another way!
Tell me later.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
I killed him???
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
No. You never worked Berlin.
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Sounds like a threat.
I'm working on it.
And the Germans can't match it?
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
What? The tapes?
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
It was in Latin, sir.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
He was a modest man.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
The Scots will fight for us?
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
You mock us with a smile?
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Hamish, I... thank...
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
Armed?
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
It matters not, he is thy king!
Thank you for inviting.
You are. And I'll come again.
...Tonight!
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
...I wouldn't know.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
And the bad news?
How soon?...
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
Cute, Evan.
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
You know my father?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Where are my goddamn books?
Like Ozzy.
What the fuck are you doing?
Damn. Your dad did this?
It was a long time ago.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
So it didn't feel... weird?
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
I walk differently?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Been there, done that.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Deal. Now read me something.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What's wrong with you?!
Huh?
I come from a big family.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Yes, Monsieur.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
What is your name?
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose we do.
Practically no one.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
What are they?
And the other alternative?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Yes.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
Richard, I had to see you.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
No, not yet.
Everything is quite all right.
No.
But what about us?
And I said I would never leave you.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Go ahead.
My office.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
You love her that much?
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Very well.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Perhaps.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Yeah? What's his name?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Okay.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Put that gun down.
I never make plans that far ahead.
There seems to be no secret about that.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Put that phone down!
Put it down!
-- You thought what?
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Good. Then have a drink.
Then don't have a drink.
Yes, boss.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Do too much, I'll die.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Shut up.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
Had a package to deliver.
I thought I did.
You don't seem too happy about it.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
For when I travel?
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
I can't take him to work.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
Great.  Really.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
No.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Don't you even think about it.
What's going on down there?
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Hallelujah.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
San Francisco.  And you?
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
They just want you to hire some new help.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Burma!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
"King Kong". It's really good.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
It will be okay.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
She knows how to take care of herself.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
I can't go nowhere.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I never said they were boring.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She looks after other people's children.
Someone not from Maine.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Okay...
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Right.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
We heard that one already, Homer.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
We see you next harvest.
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Everything looks in order.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
The standard ten.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
After you cut her loose.
Today? Started off great...
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Let's go, Jake?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
Eight A.M. flight.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
I can't do that.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
I think I just broke my hand.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
You get an equal cut.
Just play a part. A little acting.
I'll worry about Customs.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Glenn talked you out of it.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
No, I want my cut!
You better get over to Al's. Now.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
With identification.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Keep it up.
What?
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Eee Oott Auught!
In over your head?
I can handle it.
It's not history.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Goodnight.
I despise the job.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
How about five hundred.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I want a job, Giles.
Who was he?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
How did you land that?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
You've got such beautiful hands.
Tension. It'll go.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Gambling's not about money.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Then what?
Leave me alone, Marion.
Found a job?
It's not that.
Well, thank you anyway.
There's a casino in this hotel.
So why did you come to my casino?
First visit to London?
In the casino.
Absolutely not.
That's fine.
Then you're not a pro.
What kind of trouble?
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
You're serious.
I can't do it, Jani.
I told you, all bets are off.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Who...
Who did it? Tell me!
Turn left at the lights.
Nice car.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
No.
Any exceptions?
Five.
Five.
What for?
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
Does he win?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
I read the same here.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Energy shielding positive function.
Armed.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Yes, well...
...nine seconds...
I have no proof that it was false data.
Yes, Doolittle.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Which one?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Who cares?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Well, what you might try is --
Doolittle, hello?
Talk to the bomb.
Bruno's girlfriend.
I'm on a break.
That's not why we're here.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
What're you talkin' about?
No.
She was there...
I don't get involved with guns.
Yech...
SHHH!  Don't do that!
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Mommy, where are you?
Mommy, I'm scared.
Wasn't that hard.
Lauren's not my wife.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
I won't be staying.
It was open.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
You need to get out more.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How well do you remember the lab?
A girl.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
We're quoting Mom again.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
I understand.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
How's this about me?
You're crazy.
Where?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
They're prisoners to their genes.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Pull the cash.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
What if he's on the level?
Later.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
I'm a toy to her.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Got any KISS?
Right, slow...
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
A bustier?
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Donnie.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Not until like... eighth grade.
Donnie! Give it back!
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I'm sorry.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
I'm going home.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
And you'd never been there before?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
It's safe here.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Do they know yet?
Where it came from?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
How so?
I don't own a television.
He said to follow him.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Why?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Congratulations.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
Yep.
But now you can't go.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
She's right over there.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Oh God, I'm dead...
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Your parents'd kill you.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Yah?
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Yes...
Then it must be Wednesday.
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
My dress'll reek.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
What?
All right, then.
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Nothin' too showy!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Yeah.
We need more bars!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Harold!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
The king can do to wrong! 
Take a letter.
"My President"...
"My"...
"My dear"...
Send for my car...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Go ahead.
And Vera niece, too.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I don't remember.
No, that wasn't it...
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Two, please.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Hmmm?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Yes?
Did you see it?
I'll show you! I'll show you!
He fell.  He falls.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Indeed!
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
...Yes, Sir.
I could easily arrange...
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Yes.
You've never been?
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Oh no, my friend...
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Yyyess.
My name is...
Say "Merrick".
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Righteousness...
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Yes, John?
I thought as much.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Fine.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
Welcome home, John.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
There IS no one.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
What are what?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
We never went to bed together.
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
I... but I...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
It was my master Keitel's idea.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Well... isn't it great?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
REALLY?
Well, how d'you think I feel?
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
You've got to let me go!
Yes... oh, yes...
Shut up.
You don't love ME.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
But...
Very deep... usually...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
I met this girl...
You may need a real Berserk.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
ROW!
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
Keitel Blacksmith?
But how could he know... unless...
But...
I was sitting there.
We haven't got a spare place.
She MUST have a knife or something...
Let me do something for myself for a change!
Bye... sorry...
What do we have to do?
Your lord.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
Well... I... I thought...
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
But it's a responsibility...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mum.
I told you that later.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
You did? You liked me?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
I'm Joel.
I'm not nuts.
Yes?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Very much.
You pick it.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Thanks.
Yeah.
That's scary sounding.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
No, it isn't that.
What do you mean?
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Okay.
I'm Joel.
Okay.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Um, no.
Oh.
Female.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Yeah.
What if?
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Your dried cum.
Hi.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
You have to stop this!
You take it. I don't know.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Go back to sleep.
I hope you get your work done.
We'll speak soon.
What?
Where?
You better go.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
How did I look?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Hi.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
It was a mutual decision.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
She came to help, Howard.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
This one's history. Moving on...
Patrick, we need to focus.
I'm staying with the Countess.
About...
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
What is Debbie's position?
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
I don't know anything about it.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Coop, where are you...
No, thank you.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Hurry.
Run!
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
"Another man?" Who?
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
He's crashing...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
There's no one here, Skipper.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
It's complicated...
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
I don't know.
The Core...!
Yes...
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
NOOO!
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Starck, give me a read.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Justin?
Keep your eyes open.
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
What is it, Starck?
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Ship's log.
It means nothing.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Youthful high spirits.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
He's made a few changes.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Go back to the drawing board.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
What about you?
Ben, are you there?
You've been working out.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
They're not costumes.
Okay, "mom."
Girl...?!
Blockhead started it!
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Never better.
I was talking about us. Working together.
It's been changed.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
That's what we're here to find out.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
And reverse the mutations --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
You need a doctor.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Ben did this.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Raising the shields.
Susan. What are you doing?
Arnold. What's happening?
Don't worry about it.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Sis.
Your friends use the pool too.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Why?
See you later.
Yes, sir.
Get a ride with somebody.
Sure. Come on in.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
No. It's too soon.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Whatever you say, Rat.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
That's me, Merv.
They're fuckin' with us.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Should we buy a frame for that?
He was hot, wasn't he?
Believe it.
No way! He just called him a dick.
I know.
What variables?
It was okay.
It was nice.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
That little prick.
That little prick.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
What do you want?
Yeah, like maybe never.
Really?
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
I don't know. I guess so.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Two Cokes.
Yes... It makes sense.
Awake? What do you mean?
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
WHAT?
Dobermans don't talk.
Naw! Not a major.
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
Jesus! Did I say that?
Damn right!
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You whore!
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
How about a check?
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Plans?
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
They were all veterans.
Me?
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
Never missed a plane yet.
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Where's that?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Hey!
There's a tunnel.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Just move!
Just an observation.
My truck.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Well...
Oh.
Huh?
Nothing.
Fully.
Two.
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
No bullshit.
Gimme the keys.
HELLLPPP!
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Nothing, just lookin'.
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
And the last one is the...
That's one piece of four problems.
Let's lock off this room.
Well...
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
My clothes?
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I'm not!
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
He's not here.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
He knows, Frances.
In my eyes, officer.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Claire?
What night?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
I know you believe that.
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
Thanks, Dad.
Always. Always.
Thank you.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
I wouldn't miss it.
They'll mend.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry.
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Enh.
What happened to him?
...So you think I should go.
Yeah.
What?
Kaminski.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Who said I was a lady?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
I love you too, Frances.
Just a little way.
Yes.
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
You got it.
Yes, Ma.
Smile, little sister, smile.
You're taking me home!
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Why are these all opened?
What's wrong?
I'll be back.
Yes, Mama.
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
I will, I promise.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
I have!
Don't I know you?
Oh bullshit.
I see.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
No!
What kindness?
Kill me and have done with it.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Quite right!
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
Fine.
Nothing can. Not ever.
The world is a dizzying place.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Very well then.
I resent God's monopoly.
Is that your diagnosis?
Thank you, Henry.
Let it go.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
The strain was evident.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I was careless.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
I'll go take a look.
Marcie?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Where'd you get that stuff?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Dancer.
Whatever you make yourself.
That was the telephone.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Mmmmmmmph.
Girls can't be cowboys.
One night on the town.
That's thirty percent.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
The truth hurts.
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
On the dresser.
Sorry, I need everybody.
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Yes, they do.
Yes.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
You won't let him touch her?
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Yes.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Me too.
Later.
-- you got your shower --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
You believe me don't cha?
No.
Feels good.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Cops.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Or what?
Really?
I've been accused of that wish.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Your prerogative, Senator.
Standing right here in my office.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Pardon?
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
I'm not sure what --
Smoke her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
I was one member of the investigating commission.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Sir?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
What?
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Whose orders were those?
He was married?
You got anybody, Wick?
I think you look beautiful.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Should I be afraid?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
North?
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
But we can get to the west side faster.
What?
Yeah, well...
Sure. I'd like that.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Speak of the devil.
Who is he?
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Call me Charlie.
So have dinner with me tonight.
It's your choice.
What?
We? I don't think so.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
Me too.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
Get your people out of there or I will.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Thanks.
Why do you need that?
You were right.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Just don't.
Is that the bathroom?
Thanks.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
I'm... I'm shot.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
You go first! There's no time!
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Why didn't you stop at the market?
You could order something in.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Nobody was WATCHING?
No I didn't.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Okay, now. But-
There is no weather in space.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right. Put me back on with him.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Where'd they go? Back inside?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
You smiled at me.
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Let me think. I need time to think.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Gwen...
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Closer?  I can try.
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
NO, Thank God he has not.
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Well... Sort of...
You can oc that?
And determination.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
While they're strung out?
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
You go too far, Benedict.
Yes, general?
No.  I guess.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Delighted, sir.
We better, Congress invented him.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
Detained by what?
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Uh... none just now, but...
I... they look both the same.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
I rode here, on my horse.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
General Lee, sir!
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Martha!  For God's sake!
I want you to see our hospital.
Yessir!
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
But not more than your comfort.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
It's stupid, of course.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
Let's get you darker!
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
So where's the money?
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
No. What's this?
Not too bad.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Your who?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Who?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
What money?
It's a different kind of deal.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
That's the magic number.
Who is this?
Okay. So who are you?
Never heard of him.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
I don't like waiting.
I'm in the movie business.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Where you been, Harry?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
I know what a marker is.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
The shylock's the good guy.
They always paid.
Once.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
"Mr. Lovejoy".
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
He drown?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You're kidding, right?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
His shrink's trainer.
Personally?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Like this?
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Who told you that?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
I'll find you, Leo...
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
How much is the wife offered?
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
I just caught the end.
There a part in it for you?
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Oh.
What happened?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
You're as bad as Harry...
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Don't say a fuckin' word.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
I'm going into the movie business.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Murray's dead.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Be quiet and listen.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry -–
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Oh, yeah, sure.
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Sixty pounds.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Bring it on, dude.
Gimme a break.
Seen a lota movies.
Oh yeah.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Why not?
Yeah, yeah.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
Smugglers maybe.
What is it?
How long to fix?
The right way and the wrong way.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Three, four days.
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Murphy.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
There's a charming thought.
Too big. More like a freighter.
It's my pen name.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
So what did happen?
Did you see him?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Same. Any luck?
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Hey.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Of course they did.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Maybe.
Lost my sea legs.
You've been out for about a day.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Shut up.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Who?
How should I know?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
I just buzzed him in.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Well, yes...
Huh?
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Jesus...
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Can I come in?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Why?
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
Oh yeah.
Why do I always have to do it?
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
We should follow him home.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
What, is she black now?
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
It's always closed...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
I don't believe you.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Like what?
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Which one?
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Go ahead...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You're insane.
What thing?
Nothing.
It's fine.
That's all you're bringing?
It just came yesterday...
Well, we won't keep you.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Tell me what?
You don't know what you're talking about.
God, fuck you!
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Oh, right...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
PLEASE? We have to!
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
What? Why?
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Are you okay?
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Who knows?
So, what happened?
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I had to see you.
Can you at least let me in?
Do you have anything to drink?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
I-I-I...
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I am.
Right, exactly!
I don't know... where is she, then?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
That slut!
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Yes?
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
How; we don't know where they are?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Starling?
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
I assure you we came close many times-
Does he speak English?
Shhh.
What?
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
But you said they were always old.
What did I do?
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
I can try.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
We don't have a relationship.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Same difference.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
I await the word of Vigo.
Who are they?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Do I?
Did I forget something?
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
You need the exercise.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Something good --
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
I hate Jello.
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
That's a violin concerto.
No?  What do I act like?
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Really!  Is it gone?
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
I think it's the food of the future.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
See!  They are using drugs.
Then my theory was correct.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
What?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Oh, shit!
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
To go into business for ourselves.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Well, that ought to do it.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
LATER, MAN!!
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Yes?  Go on!
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Not yet, dear brother...
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
They won't break this one.
On what charge?
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Until your confirmation date.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
God of passages and changes?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
You're hearing about somebody else.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Would that Marcus had lived.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
So I understand.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
They fear me.
Tomorrow?
I can't let you do that.
They're studying with Cynics.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
You teach them!
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Don't be ridiculous.
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
No.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Wait a minute.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
GET OUT!
Get out of here.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
What do you think?
Because it isn't true.
Then what?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
I don't know.
No.
I might.
I don't see how we can.
I'll think about it.
Yes.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Carl who?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Thank you.
Mr. McQuire.
What?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Because I don't like you.
I want you out of here.
I am going to call the police now.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What?
A single. Just for myself, please.
What?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
That's right.
What?
No.
I'm very neurotic.
What?
All right. Now finish your drink.
Benjamin?
I know that. But I'm --
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
What if he did?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Yes.
Of course.
I haven't. No.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes.
The number.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
What?
You're welcome.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Is this -- what?
Wait a minute!
INADEQUATE!
Go ahead then.
I don't.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
I walk out.
He's asleep.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
What?
We don't.
Why are you asking me all this?
Oh my God.
Why not?
Then let's hear them.
Benjamin?
You're not.
Don't start acting hurt.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Go home now.
When I go off?
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Not if you don't want to.
-- worried?
What about it?
No.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Thank you.
Oh no.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
That what he says. Right?
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Why?
No --
You can't.
Have you seen it?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Chasing what?
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Why do you hide in my room?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
And...?
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
What?
Oh -- 
I don't want them now.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Bless you --
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I did not ask your advice.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Good heavens. What for?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
No, Doctor.
You are ill.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Stay where you are.
No.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Yes -- that --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Moreover...
No -- only occasional jobs. 
I got ten marks for that.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Oh, yes.
Well, he's a gentleman!
I had to arrange about the trip.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
And I said we didn't.
You've decided against the merger?
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
We did not approach you.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Good morning, Madam.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
I wish to be alone.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
I could not think of not accepting.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
That.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And if you do it wrong?
What's that, Lilly?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Can't move.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
It's not your fault.
Roy Dillon.
Just myself.
Perk.
Fair enough.
They twisted my arm.
Only one tooth?
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
No. And you have to be.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
I pay my debts.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
In your other hand.
Taking you for granite?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
You called the doctor, huh?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Mama!
Because it's comfortable.
I'll sign that affidavit.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
And when he got serious?
Yeah? How?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
For Christ's sake, why not?
Yes?
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
You up to it now?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Happy to see you looking so good.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Doesn't look good.
What the fuck are you talking about?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
My office?
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Forget it.
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Will, sit down...
Yes.
John, you can't help her now.
John...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
That would work.
You stole it?
Why not?
I came to see you.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Okay... thank you.
It's not going to happen.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Are you going to leave, too?
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Why?  You interested?
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Answer what?
He says things.  Bad things.
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
He's gone.
But surely Rogers isn't --
Or what's left of him.
I'll meet you over there.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Why did you take Jamie?
Samhain.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
It's a bitch.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
At least!
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
This room is full of ghosts.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
Let's talk about something else.
First Nagasaki--now this.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
Really?
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
In what way, pray tell?
You're an imbecile.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
Our pleasure.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
You're making a joke.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Hello.
Is anybody besides you here now?
Where's Mom?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Everybody says he was so brave.
He worships Father.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
He insults him all the time.
Mhravitch.
Uck.
Where did you get the poison?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
They're not engaged.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Scat!
Damn.
Leave a tip.
Nothing.
No.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
Heaven.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought a doctor might help.
We thought it was an emergency.
Nothing would please me more.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I did?
It's so--so stark.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
They don't have to feel like slaves.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
What are you going to do?
If he wants to go.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
What a handsome word.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
No.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
There it is.  Give it to me.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And her fiancé!
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I was going to ask.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
I've struck my blow.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
I dunno.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
I heard you were looking for me.
Yes.
I don't care what she wears.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Don't!
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's alive!
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Father's friend.
Don't know.
That man is your father.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
That's something I suppose.
Yeah.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
How nice.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
You're saying no.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
Tonight's the night.
That's the XKE.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
It's a jungle out there.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
It's really that bad?
Not true.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
Yes, we do.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Wait?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah...
That's all you got, three girls?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Overpowering?
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Yeah.
Do you know where she lives?
Tod might know.
Half now, half later.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
'Sucking off.'
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Tijuana.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Who's paying you?
That's right.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
What have you found out?
Where is she?
They are?
But the police...
Like what?
I just heard. Who is he?
Just leave me alone.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
What?
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Yeah.
I want to meet Ratan.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
Ratan!
Let's go.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
What do you think of that? Or this?
You ever play Chicken?
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
To anybody.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
I'm a file clerk.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Harold Chasen.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Well...
It is kind of rough.
Look, the ice is melting.
Well, I really don't drink...
But I don't play anything.
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Maude.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But why now?
I have a sore throat.
What?
I don't care what people say.
Harold!
Perhaps it is.
Can't complain.
Like a tea ceremony?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
I go to funerals.
Yes.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Oh yes. That's fine.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
We've always been here.
Yes!
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
I know.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
And what about you?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
You were ALL human!
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Story of my life.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
No. It's not.
I thought you liked being on TV.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Father's back?  Still angry?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Alone?
I like that...
He's just pushy.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
Coffee's warming me up.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Two steps back, please.
Hi.
We're leaving.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's important.
Oh Christ.
No.
Poor baby.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
Oh.
Forget him.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Hurting.
What?
You promised me an explanation.
Hell...
And the blood let you out?
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
No. I'm not.
So what's the argument?
Larry....
O.K.
Kirsty.
No. I'll do it.
I don't know where to begin...
It's better you see for yourself --
There's a first time for everything.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
That's right.
What's wrong?
No Dad.
YOU'D like my room.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
You like?
Is Julia here?
Sure.
Really?
Sure.
I want to see.
I AM house-trained.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Don't let them take me, Steve --
Sure. Why not?
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
What band?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
No way.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
You can be and are wrong.
On Clark Street!
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Fine.  That's great.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Can I help you?
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
No.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Fine.  One.
Is what better?  Better than what?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Have you slept with him yet?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
I don't have your number.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Well, think about it.
I can't talk right now.
Uh... No.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
C'mon.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
What's the difference?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
You're tougher.
You're being stupid.
No use.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Fair enough.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Right.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Sure.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
It's my birthday.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
You?
Have you gone to the police?
Are you?
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
At least.
You won't.
He knows about you.
That's insane.
You killed those other two.
Will I see you again?
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
The inheritance.
Now there's a new topic.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
I was nearly killed.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
You're a long way from Inverness.
Yes.  Always.
It is less.
You are still so very young.
This is madness!
No!
This can't be.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Go to hell.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
I feel hardly nothing.
I'll be back when I can.
But I did live.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Far away.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Mulet.
You seem to understand a great deal.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
Figure she's with him?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Head still secure to the neck.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
He always did.
You're insane.
You're wrong.
Not so long.
Of sorts.
MACLEOD!
Leave her out of this.
Yes.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Same.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Seventy-five.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Hello, Bruce...
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Fine.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Yes!
No -- she didn't.
No. My mother.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
How?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Thanks a lot.
So long.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
The money? Why?
You'll ask me to what?
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Get out of here, you!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Get away, Svengali.
Look at this! 
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Where'd you meet this man?
What's his line?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Say, could I meet him?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
No kidding?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
We're not interested.
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
I know, but --
I'd like to think.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Huh!
Where's some paper?
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Where's Butch?
What tickets?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
You been in a fight?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Murder, uh?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
What?
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Me, too.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
What do I know about Williams?
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Throw him out, Frank.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Now, Hildy --
My name is Louis Peluso.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
And up a dime.
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Mother!
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
You can't bribe me!
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I know.
Very well, Grandpa.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
What's that?
I don't mind.
Yes.
Bugger off.
Would.
We thought it was poison.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
The sodding water table.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Kiss me Hardy.
Naturally.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
You taste it.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Fair enough.  The river.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
And now we're glad you did.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
You're welcome.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
You shouldn't a done that.
Yeah, I'll do something.
I don't.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
I don't know.
What's that?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Hmmmmm.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Shhhhhh.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I don't know... about half an hour.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Keys.
Firefly.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Enough with the stupid voices.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
I um... no, I don't think so...
What! God damn, how many?
Well, go get her.
Fit the profile?
I ain't got a warrant.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Aw, fuck.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
That must be him.
We found one.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Like father, like son.
French?
Oui.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Not in front of the boy.
No. You look so beautiful.
No!
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Please let me go with you.
Okay.
But I like being human now.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Always. Ow.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
You are a therapist, right?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
Paper or cloth?
I'm not sure.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
Nathan!
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Terrific. Can't wait!
Fifteen.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
All right.
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Good. Making progress.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Oh boy!
Ooka.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Even better.
here, here.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
No.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Yep.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
No, I'm fine.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
You ever played billiards before?
It's possible.
Twelve thousand.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
What is?
You being cute?
I got drunk.
Whaddya been so far?
Why?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Now, when did you adopt me?
I been thinking.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Where?
I don't know.
I said we're leavin'.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
I asked around.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
I told you you'd get your money back.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Okay?
Yeah, sure has.
Okay, friend.
You're a pretty good player.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Call it.
Thanks. I will.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I used to be an actress.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
You want to go with me?
I'm getting treatments right here.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Yeah. For a little while.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Me. It's Eddie.
Why did he tell you?
I love you.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Why should I?
Well, what's the matter?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Have you looked inside?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
Yes.
You got that right.
If we want it, it is.
Okay.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Was there anything over the hill?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
George, you're acting very strangely.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
Yes.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Hide the car.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
What kind, Mom?
It's really nice of you to help us.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
He's a good man.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
More than likely.
What's the bad news?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
What happened?
That signal. It's a countdown.
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Dad...
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
She didn't take my name when we were married.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
Oh shit, we're late.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Then God help us.
But Mr. President...
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Yes, Sir.
But what, General?
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
How long would their shields be down?
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
What?
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Butt-munch.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
How to kiss ass.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
You sure?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
We're leaving.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Here... now.
Die.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
Yes. My treat.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
Dad was onto something here!
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
I'm going after Dad.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
What?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Are you sure?
What?
Don't call me that, please.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
She talks in her sleep.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
My lucky charm.
What???
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
...the solution presents itself.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Booby traps?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Relax.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
And do I detect a rebuke?
It happens to me all the time.
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
After you, Junior.
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
Miss Scott panicked?
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
You don't like him do you?
No.
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Behind you!
What?
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Siam.
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
It's pulling me deeper!
PET IT??!!
THE WHAT?!
It's starting to let go!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Oh really?
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
You're talking to an authority in that area.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
A what?!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I'm going down.
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yes.
Go!
Not quite.
And they don't even know what it really is.
You got it!
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
What's going on?
It wasn't him.
Me.
Al.
...I need to make a phone call.
Right.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Me? What'd I do?
You said it.
Hear voices don't I.
Yeah.
With a man in my head...
Who was that? Somebody out there?
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
I am. You are.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
With Authority!
Take a left and your next right.
I can't remember..
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
What am I supposed to do?
We'll change your appearance.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
What is it?
You eat it.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
The sand.
Why not?
Where are you going? Wait!
.
Where are you staying?
Well you did it today.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
Who, me?
Just hold them close and stay still.
She's the toughest to read.
This just won't work.
What am I supposed to do?
Oh come on.
Shit! You're in love.
It's not your time. I get time off.
Why don't you get out of my face.
Follow her.
I can't keep up.
You think. That's what you're good at.
Drink lots of water.
You have to! Quickly!
You were with GRUNER!
Come on.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
While he makes the run.
You've changed your mind.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I'll get us out of here.
That's nice.
It's all we've got.
It'll remind me of you.
Oh, I can't.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
It's just money.
What?
What about it?
Oh.
Do what?
Who...are you?
Thanks.
Oh.
I feel fine.
Oh yeah, thanks...
Been complaning of hallucinations.
A little voice in my head.
No. No one to speak of.
Blake?
Yes?
Where?
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
I just work for the travel firm.
Me still. They left you alone?
I am sort of scattered.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
How often they come here?
Wanted to get to know you.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
What's he done?
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
I asked him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
You coming along?
Why?
You can say that again. What do we do?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
It was my choice.
You're gonna laugh.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Do something!
But you did it. It was you.
That's twenty feet high.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
A drink...
Just one. The back up.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Yes.
It'l be alright.
Poor bastard.
Whoever took it does.
Okay.
In the backyard.
Yes, baby?
I'll be there.
Monday.
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Okay. 
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
That's my stuff from the office...
What's the difference...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
...you fucked me!
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
I'll call you then.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
Everything interests me.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Far as you go where?
Did work.
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
It's obvious, isn't it?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
No.
You believe that?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I heard.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I don't know what to do.
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
What?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
You called me.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Here. Got pictures.
I had no idea until after, but --
What part?
No...
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
No frown lines.  New watch?
I should be in therapy.
Got any symptoms?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Thanks, buddy.
Asian? No.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
So, that's good, right?
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
I'll be right back.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Isn't everything?
What does your lawyer think?
I know you do.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
He wants a reconciliation.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Yes.
Do you want to sleep on it?
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I bet.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
That's true.
Murder?
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Please!
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
He has a reputation for being tough.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I don't know. I can assume...
I'm not sure.
Well -- is that possible?
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Video.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
What are they?
What...?
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Who's Rex's guy?
Muriel Rumsey.
Yes, I know—but—
The reward.
Do you love her?
I'll get it annulled.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Why? Do you know him? 
I'm sorry you read it.
I suppose so.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Yes, of course.
What happened to your money?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Oh—the papers—
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Are you talking to me?
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
The pleasure is all mine.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Outside!
I can't go out like this.
Hurry up and get dressed.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer—we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
What are you talking about?
Well, you were!
Next week "East Lynne."
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
Why, haven't you—?
I'm following you.
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
What?
Try me.
Hitch-hiking.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Come on! come on! 
Darling!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter—
You bet I did.
I'm out! I'm out!
Do you know?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
What's that?
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is—"  No, do you really?
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Who?
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
There's a seat over there for you.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Why?
What's on your mind?
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Orange, New Jersey.
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
Calm down, Dave, what?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
Why Galveston?
And then Sunday?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
A Willie O'Keefe?
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
Who?
They're gonna love you, chief.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Ever ask him?
His name?
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
More than ten years.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
She's the best damn witness we have!
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Uh huh.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Who?
A bit.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Hey, Jackie.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
I'm not saying another word.
What's in it?
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Great.
I am, as a matter of fact.
Shit.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
Cash poor?
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Yeah.
Sure.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
How'd you find that out?
Surprise.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
How was it?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
In the bag underneath.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Not every day?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Yeah?
Can I smoke?
A Broadway shopping bag.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
What's her story?
What did you say?
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Do you got something for me?
Got some o.j.?
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I knew it.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Go sit over in that chair.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
Who?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Managers get ten percent.
Uh-huh.
What'd you care?
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Susanville.
Bank robbery.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
Must of made quite an impression.
Sure.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Yeah, down the end.
Are you serious?
Then what?
I'm in my underwear.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
Sure.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Not now, pick me up.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
You know how she is.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
It's in there.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Tell me.
How am I supposed to know that?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Watcha gonna see?
Have fun.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
You think you could do that?
You don't say.
House.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Did the police contact you?
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And you did that to protect my interest?
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
That I gotta see.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
I know where it is.
Yeah.
No.
You know it's for you.
He leave town?
Give me his home number.
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No! Oh God.
No, don't. But thanks.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
What do you want from me?
It's short, huh?
Just my luck.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
You need ... a doctor.
What can I tell you?
What did she have to say?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Sarah.
She talk about the boys?
What?
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Hell, you think I am?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Thanks.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
No. The little one.
Why you left.
Gabe.
When was the last time I said a word?
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
They weren't human!
Where?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
The numbers stop at 107.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Are we in Brooklyn?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I love you, Jez.
I don't believe this.
Let go!
Stay away from me, Jez.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Stick with me, kid.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Sit down, Jake.
You know who I am.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Shows how much you knew.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
What is it?
I don't know.
I don't know what to say.
Hot. Where do I sign?
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
What is wrong with you?
What?!
Help me!
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Nothin' much.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Nope.
What's wrong?
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
You come home with me.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
How did it happen?
He doesn't like it.
Punk?
You got lucky.
Speaking of which, duck!
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
We're not leaving Crutch!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
What?
Delongpre! Out of time!
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Get out of here!
He came for me, I had to run!
I think I broke my arm.
They're back here.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Two more charges to go.
I don't know!
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
My job.
You got that right.
What?
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
I hope so.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
And what happend to ...?
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Shut up, Thorgan!
You lost the charge?
They'll make it.
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
GO, GO, GO!
Small brains make your balls itch?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Crutch?
Maybe she tripped.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
I'm just saying.
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
See you then . . . doctor.
4You're not going anywhere.
Exactly.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
My boat's neat, dad!
You got it.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Where...?
Shut up! Just pump her out!
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Have you ever had one do this?
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Do you see the kids?
No. Home here.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
Why?
Who are you?
What d'ya mean?
Let's all have a drink.
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
You could say that.
What stinks so bad?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Chum?
Why don't we just tow it in?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
Some friends and me took a house.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
You're leaving?
This is Quint, Missus.
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
No way! He can't!
Thanks for the message.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Or something.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Were we together?
What?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Okay.
No... I guess not.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
What are you talking about?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Hon, did you get expelled?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
You don't know anything about me!
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
You weren't even alive!
Yeah.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
You know... it's parts...
You don't have to do that.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Why? What the big deal?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
What are you?
What's the matter?
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
God, you're so young.
I heard that was you.
Sure.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Elbow.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
I'm pregnant.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Share the love, Tits!
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Karma.
...Yeah, sure.
How'd you meet Early?
You can?
Sure.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Do what?
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Almost.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
As many times as it takes.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Early! Stop!!
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Walter Livesy.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Nah... how much money have you got?
...Ha.
A book on the warehouse murders?
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
What are you going to do?
No, thanks, I can manage.
No.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
Without his car?
Yes.
Was up bitch?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Are you hungry?
Den less go Joe.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Yeah.
Right.
Yep.
Yeah.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Nothen' B.
Right here.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
At the block party?
She won't? Why not?
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Bang up stuff.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
I wouldn't believe it?
What?
I guess so.
You're OK?
No.
Yeah?
Thanks.
Yeah?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
I didn't bleed.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
I only did it once and...
Yeah?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Making love is like.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah.
He still does.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's grandmother style.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
OK.
What kind of problem?
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
Maybe you should.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
No it wasn't.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
What?
Sit down!
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Run it down.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Sanderson?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
He was with me?
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You're not going to tell me that.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
Fuck off!
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Of course.
My cheering section.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Okay.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Thanks, David.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
What did he mean by Huxley?
That's a big area to cover.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Through a rental agency.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Whatever's on your mind.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
How can you look at it so clinically?
Let's change the subject.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Because I think he's wrong.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
I'm sorry.
And you?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
What do you want on it?
Then why are you backing up?
Can I come in?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
But I do.
Why not?
Of course not.
Are you going to come tonight?
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
<u>What</u>?
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Colwyn.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
Yes.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
He has come for Lyssa.
Yes.
Where the spiral begins.
No! You cannot know that!
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
He saved our lives.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
These we'll pay for.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
I ...  ... am Titch.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
It is important to assure the succession.
A match for your son, I think.
How many did you lose?
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
That is true.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
We had no children.
It is no trickery.
No?
...What?
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Yes, yes...
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Yes.
No, you can't go out.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
What?
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
...I don't know.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
Yes.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
...I got lost, Mister.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
No...
Salute.
Why am I such an authority?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
How serious is it?
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Pardon?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
You have?
Okay.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Yes.
Show me.
You like to take walks?
I've changed my mind.
It'll make it.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
This guy's not a murderer.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
What was that?
Maybe.
You're amazing.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
I told you.
She knew you loved her.
Why know?
Saluting.
Don't do this.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
Someone should be with you.
Forty-seven years.
What?  Who are you?
What are my choices?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
To death?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
We?
Let's stay for a while.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Where have you been staying?
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Are we done for today?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Who could better understand than me?
How?
Yes.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
I don't know.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
So?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Neat.
Thanks again for your help!
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
What, like on va-kay?
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
Why not?
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
No, silly. I go here.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
I gave her my word, Warner.
See?
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Yeah, luckily.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
I am afraid of nothing.
What do you want from me?
I don't expect you'd understand.
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Jack, don't!
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Something the matter?
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
It doesn't matter.
Sunlight, you say?
Mean you to seek him out below?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Patience, lad.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
And did you?
No, no, no... this is different!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Sorry.
Never.
Or perchance...
Unicorn?
They rival the angels of paradise.
Are you honest?
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
To fetch your napkin.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Jack... Forgive me...
You've freed me, Jack...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Everywhere!  Ow!
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
She's dead!
You'll visit again?
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
I pray God grants it me.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
Be fair, Oona.
We wait.
Up ahead!
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
You follow.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
He seems lonely.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
What are you doing here?
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I'll get your back.
I can use your mom's.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Not if what he left me was real.
He's got a standing invitation.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
It's thirty feet.
Months.
What are you on?
how much weight have you lost?
That's too long.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
I'm sorry.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I'll ask.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
No I'm not!
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'll get your bag.
You have everything?
You don't have a choice.
I almost saw Catalina.
Goodnight.
No you don't.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
I don't know.
A friend of yours is here.
Sit down for a second.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
Don't.  I don't want it.
Hi, Mom.
What do you know about me?
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I'm telling you now.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
That's so weird...
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Here.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Thanks for telling me.
I want you to find someone for me.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
But you can't call me while you think?
Why call me?
I don't have a phone.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Which?
What have you been before today?
Do you remember?
I'd rather you not be here.
That was the truth.
You bit my finger.
I didn't think you'd come today.
No.  Mostly me.
What did he say?
It's not my back that's killing me.
No.
You got any weed?
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
I could use the money.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
It's not ours.  It's George's.
No.
Can you stay for dinner?
Why?
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Nigger.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
But you can't.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Take care of me?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
Goodnight, Claude.
But I'm having a good time...
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Yeah, I want some pie.
What gave you that idea?
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Still got that ten dollars?
He even got my daddy's watch.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
What about you, Radio?
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Yeah.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
I'm stuck!
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
So?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
What were they, bootleggers?
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Are you offering me a bribe?
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Satchmo.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
Understood.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Urr... uggg... errr...
Show him Central Park.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
You're already there...
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
I think you're looking at him.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
So go get 'em, Dad!
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
That's a pretty brassiere.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Beast.
What was it called, sir.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Oh, would you grow up.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Peppermint... alright.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
You followed him?
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
I'll just go to Heaven.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
School?
What was that?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
I have to, Valerie.
From my dad's side of the family.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
I don't know.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
All right -- what are you?
From? From? From?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Your own work?
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Just wondered... what happens?
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
It has nothing to do with you.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
I thought I had to do something.
Why is it wrong to run?
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
K.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
You know.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I let him go... believe me.
I don't have much time.
That's nice.
He's good, isn't he?
It's the only way.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
It could be...
Beloved wife...
Yes...
Oh, my...
I have always been here...
What makes you think so?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No, no, no
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
Alive?
Oh my... I'll try.
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Too little.
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Okay.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Sure, I'm okay.
This is our bedroom.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
Right... This just glided along.
Yeah... Laurent.
I can't see you tonight.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Andy?
Yeah. Call him.
Okay.
Why are ya goin' so early?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Alice, I...
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Sure.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Do ya good.
His physical condition.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
What's the word on the street?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Pete, what happened to you?
Coming up.
No... I don't. Why?
Nothin'.
He won't give his name.
Not even close.
I... I didn't say anything...
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Pornos?
Okay.
What?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
Sure.
It was weird...
Come on.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
It certainly is.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Yes!
Will you stop squawking!
I'm thinking.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
Sounds like a stall to me.
Okay, Lovey.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Nothing. Why?
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
When are you going to start?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
How do you do?
Who, for instance?
You have no disputes over women?
They were.
Centuries.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Oh, I'm so glad.
Then it's done.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Hey!
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Yes, Bob.
Dead?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What do you mean if we should get out?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
My name's Sondra.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
You see, it's not a dream.
Why?
Struggling, why?
I was just going to.
I'd love it!
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
Please don't go.
It's not even a fucking door.
I gotta be honest about something.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
I'd go with number three.
Kay, I'm sorry...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Kay...
Sir--
Sir, you can't just--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
You don't know the half of it.
I taught kindergarten.
It was a long time ago.-
Something seem unusual to you about that?
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
A what?
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Where to?
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
For how long?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
You figured what?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
This guy.  Where was he?
May I have a look?
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Fine.  Good.
What the hell is going on?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
They went right to the President.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Is it now?
Someplace safe.
Then who was he?
Yes, you did.
They were performance pieces.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
Hang on, Lamar --
I understand.  Sir.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
No doubt.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
I show a cop on horseback.
Yeah?  So?
Did he close the front door?
We're in motion on something.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
So?
That's great.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Some -- somebody's father?
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
What the fuck is going on?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
I'm a little dizzy...
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
And how did Lamar become involved?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
The system would collapse.
Do you?  Really?
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I'll be right there.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I don't know, why?
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
Who?
Yes.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Have you been there recently?
But there's still the other two.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Is it a good room?
So?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
See you later.
No.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
Holy shit.
We used to take baths together.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
With what?
There's no touching.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
5-5-1.
Where's Ricky.
She was fast, huh?
That's why they call it the smart money.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Then what are you saying?
I don't understand.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Well, this is the corner.
No. That's cool, man.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Ruiz isn't here.
He's not here.
Shhh...
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
It's not even yours.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Is that the woman from..?
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Fuck...
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
Nothing.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
What the fuck do you...
Don't even start.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
I mean, that's what I heard --
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Fine.
She was jonesing for me.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
It was six in the fucking morning.
You're out of money?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
No more, man.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Well, come on then. It's back here.
What?
Drinks are free, right?
'Strapped?'
Why? What I say bad?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Word.
Soho Grand, right?
You're from LA, right?
You'll love it.
We're square.
Yes, sir.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
I'll take your goddam bet.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Yeah.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Who are you?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Tell Him that.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
You have enough worries of your own.
How old are you, Betty?
Are you?
Yes.
Because you're in trouble.
The talk is everywhere!
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
What do you want me to do?
You have to sleep for three.
Shhh!
Betty it's me. It's me.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Let me do it then.
Allah Akbar.
Say what you're saying.
With him?
I ain't stupid.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
What mission?
No. You'll be marked for death.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
You better believe it.
Me?
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
I ain't doing bad.
You the man!
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
What can you do?
That's right.
He told you that?
Am I a suspect?
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
So you are going to talk me to death.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
So what do I get in return?
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Who are you?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Who's he?]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[How do I recognize him.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Yes.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
I came to visit you.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
I'm a bargain.
That's right.
No.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
I'm not crying.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
No.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Your father has business.
It's Creasy.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
I think it's fantastic.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
[I should start going for your tits first.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
What was she to Creasy then?
And they took that away.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Yeah, sure.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Please...
Nothing.
Okay.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
I'll see you around.
That's the one.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
You gotta good heart.
Tomatoes.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
You not ugly.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
You want a beer, Ang'?
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Look at that right eye.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
You make a mean martini, kid.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Call Dago Red.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
We could steal one of the choppers.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Radar!
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Not necessarily.
That's right. We work well together.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
It isn't always this rough?
Ayuh.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Why would he do that?
Second pint.
The one and only.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
You guys got any black capsules?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
I don't think so either.
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Captain.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Nice.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Against what?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
No.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Me?
No.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Yes, sir.
Thirty dollars.
You bet I will, Ma.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
What letter?
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Oh!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
He's watching the other door.
Yeah, a little.
Where is she?
Go out and find her!
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
A gag. A gag!
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Yeah, you bet!
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Huh? Get what?
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Did you want to see her about something important?
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
Yeah.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
You're my hero.
Deal.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
They want Walter dead!
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Huh?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Is there a problem?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Roper...
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Is that all?
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
So what do I say to this guy?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Why?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Still needs work.
Damnit!
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Good question.
You heard.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
And it's hard to get.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Yeah that's it.
Scottie...
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
Scottie...
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
Yes, I believe he has --
Because I took it out of your memory.
Yes.
Guests?
Wake up?!
In a computer program.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
What about the customers with reservations?
The weather.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
Go!
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
What?
Try harder.
Then where is she?
Where?
Tanner.
-- You told me.
Way you kiss me.
There?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Resurrection.
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
Now tell me... what do you see?
Stylin'!
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
I've never been this sore in my life.
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
Where did it originate?
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
We can take these guys!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
A stellar idea, Skull.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
How about Major Moron?
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
LET'S DO IT!?
Awwh, Charlie.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
You scare me, Charlie.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
That ain't what your mama said.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
Gives us something in common.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I told you twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
What's your problem?
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
Didn't know you felt that way.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
But that's an hour's drive.
Don, I'd be honored.
The name's Charlie.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
What about the share.
I got partners.
I found that out.
They do what I tell 'em.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
We were overdue to get hit.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Just wanted ta say hello.
That a Jew compliment?
I don't know. I guess it was...
Yeah...before your time.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Stu Miley.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
<u>Why</u>??
Thank me next time you see me.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Monkeybone...!?
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
I'd better go report this...
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
What?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
What pictures?
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Mm hmm.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
... Manly?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Where's the Majority Leader?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Looks like it, but--
It couldn't be.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Would you settle for a husband?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You got worms.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Tonight?
Do we *have* to?
We're gonna get married.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Susan? Nah!
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Oh--Jim!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Oh, a *boy*!
Than what?
Why, of course.
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
No.
Here--where are you running off to?
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
Mr. President--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Jefferson--
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
There *what* was?
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Oh, but this one is so simple.
*This* is.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Try sitting down.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Terrible, thank you.
No!
In Terry Canyon?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Must have been tickled pink.
Saunders--
I'm not.
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Oh--Saunders--
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Then you *did* say it.
Well! You don't say!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
What's the matter?
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Go away, Nosey.
Okay. See you here.
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Page boys!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Sometimes twice.
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Yes, but I—
Yes!!!
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What did they say?
Yes.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
You have?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
I'd like to read it some time.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Yes, of course.
Nothing.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
With pay!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Yes.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Me sir?
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Proceed.
But your honor—
See you later, kid.
You can't?
What?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Who - me? No.
No, thank you.
No, thanks.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Entertainment?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Shut up!
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Ja.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Oh. That.
Well, I play the tuba.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Not at all.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
South Dakota north.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Yes, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
Prairie? Oysters?
Oh, I do too, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
What, sir?
You try it.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Yes, sir.
Me more than most.
Really? You think so?
One hundred books?
What happened?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Uh-huh.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Were you supposed to have a session?
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Right now?
Are we?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
My pleasure.
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I've had my moments.
What do you do?
A little.
What do you think's wrong with her?
Yes.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Yeah.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
...so accomplished.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
That would explain it.
Martin.
Mother... go away!
There's something I think we need to talk about.
Why don't you tell me?
Hmm.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Something's bothering her.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Yes.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's what I like.
Either one.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
I think so.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
How are you?
Nah... scotch.
This is exactly what I wanted.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Don't you like this?
Yep.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Just you.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
That'd be Lily.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
English Lit.
Really?
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
Sounds familiar.
I've had worse.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Intestines.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You will not believe it.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I am an English woman.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
I just decked your brother
You swear?
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
What are those mirrors for?
Preparation for what?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Very slowly.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Got what?
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
I was mistaken.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Read the inscription on the cover!
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
Head hunting.
One last tweak.
And some sandwiches --
Do it, big boy!
The Inscrutable Six?
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Sure.
Thanks.
He's dead.
Really?
I'm not that kind of girl.
You're a spy.
Me, too.
My heart died a long time ago.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
We had an off night, that's all.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Yeah.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
But I just don't feel it.
There's a vague similarity.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
The Eradicators!
Anybody got any?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Oh hi, Mom.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
I always knew that you were special.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
But how do we get in?
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
No, thank you.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Yes, sir, I am.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
It is the work of incendiaries.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I'll have the fire built up.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Yes, I am, sir.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
You must not act impetuously.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Of course.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
Open the door.  It's me.
Five minutes.
Yes.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
God help me -- yes.
I know.
Yes.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
That is correct.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Yeah.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Cheeco.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Thanks for reminding me.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Sorry about today, man.
What's the B-G's?
What about me?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Okay.
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
It's alright.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Negative...they vamped.
Let it go!
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
And some rolling papers.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
What's the matter?
Oooh, ba-by!
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Huh?
What?
Oh, yeah?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
And your husband works for somebody else.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
What's your point?
Where did you get these? Who are you?
The gun...
You fucked up.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
Let me talk to her again.
Don't you threaten me.
You know what I'm gonna do.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Over and out.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
That's right.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
What are you supposed to do?
Don't think I won't.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
Yeah.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
I kill her anyway.
Do it!
What gives?
You, Preacher?
Not even her?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
When'll the skiff be ready?
How's your sister Pearl?
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Don't!
You have all sinned!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
How do you mean?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
About what!
All to pieces!
A man of the Cloth?
Bluebeard!
Come on!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
John don't like him much.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
It's a shame!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Amen.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
You better not sing that song.
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
You what?
She's gone to Moundsville.
Why?
Ssh...
She talks to herself.
I'll make coffee.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
No. No.
It -- she --
I don't know nothin'!
I'll tell.
Yonder.
Come to me, boy!
Naturally.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
My flesh and blood!
What's wrong, John?
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
I sure as hell hope so.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Yeah.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Who?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Nan, I --
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Nancy?
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Dead and gone.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Just sleep now, Mom.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
You were screaming like crazy.
The door was locked from your side.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
He's nuts about you.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
About what?
I see.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Just for the honeymoon.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
I can tell you exactly.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
Monsieur.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
Good morning, Gaston.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
What is it, my boy?
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Get out of here!
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
Look for yourselves.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
We did it with the best intentions...
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
Au revoir.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
No.
You're welcome.
You might hold this for me.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Go ahead.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Please don't misunderstand me...
I will do my best.
Yes.
He takes good care of that.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
It's twelve o'clock.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
What?
Why?
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
No.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
I promise... I swear.
And General Savitzky.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Shhh! Shhh!
Comrades! Good people of France!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Yes, sweetheart. 
Good morning, Swana.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Is this your new dress suit?
No... please...
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Madame, if you...
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
I must insist that you leave.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Yes, it does.
May I ask why?
Thank you.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
I don't understand.
This will do. 
Raw carrots and beets.
My jewels?!
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Where the hell is he?
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Son of a bitch.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
Uh huh ...
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
Yes ... I got the money.
I'll bet he would.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
How so?
I figured that out.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
What's Liddy got?
What do you mean, sir?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
How is this national security?
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Sir?
I believe you're right, boss.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
Winning?
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
The White House.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
There's no other choice.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
I was the lesser of two evils.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... but it was all we had.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
You're shittin' me.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Yes, yes.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Is that the truth?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Do you really want this, Dick?
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
You personally?
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
They were for me.  They're mine.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Lost.
To what?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
In Angola. Yeah.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
Yes, you've circled round.
When did he die?
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Most don't.
Try "old" on for size.
You ain't heard from him?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
No.
It could be.
The old boy shot by the highway?
You sure?
I don't know...
I'm ahead of you there.
Yes sir.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Well I didn't see it.
I ain't got the money.
To your husband.
It's full a money.
At the gettin' place.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Well -- how come?
Yes I do.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
You should be used to that.
Hey.
What did you tell him?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know something better.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
Yes I did.
Where does he work?
You expect him?
Step out of the car please, sir.
No. Do you?
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I was just passin' the time.
What time do you close?
Sir?
Sir?
You've lived here all your life?
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Everything.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
That's twenty-six dollars.
Let's just call it square.
When did you last see him.
Yes?
Another additional.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
I got beers in my room.
What else then?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I been immobile.
I'm a welder.
What did I say?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
What product.
No I don't have it.
I don't know. American citizens.
No sir.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Little place called "Williams," why?
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
They're fine... you miss it?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I'd rather not...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
Are you and Larry happy?
What are you talking about?
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Yes, she is.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Didn't I?
Ad lib?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
I ran back in to get the phone.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
I'd slap his face.
Did you love it?
What's his real name?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
He has no heartbeat!
The one you were telling me about?
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
God, that's awful!
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
What? Where was he?!
Fine.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
If we're for real?
Of what?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Beer, please.
Hell of a way to die.
A mark, huh?
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
Worse... you're in Texas.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
No.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Where? Where is she?
What?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
What's wrong with you?
It is, if you like idiots...
He's waiting...
"Injuns?"
We know that...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I'll think about it.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
What the hell's going on?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
"A Reason to Love."
Mr. Campbell?
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Everett, my beard itches.
Okay, Pappy.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Helluva awgazation.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Now Penny, stop that!
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, we need that ring.
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Isn't it, uh...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
He's a suitor!
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Yeah, I know.
I wrote. Not every week...
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
No, sir!
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
Yes, sir!!
Yes, sir!
He was. He died.
Yeah.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Great.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
You hope.
I haven't made up my mind.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Seriously.
I know who you are and what you want.
You're better than candy.
What's stopping you?
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
What would you do differently?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
So?
I bet you do!
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Yeah. All week long.
He said he grew up poor?
I've seen better.
A little.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I have the gun.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
You finish.  Then we finish.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Different tables.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Shit!
Everything okay?
Oh, that phone call...
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
Don't!
No fucking way.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Why?
Well, I know that now.
0150.
PANIC ROOM!
"Get the fuck out of my house."
No.
Blue is phones?
He won't even know who it was.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
What if I do?
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Oh shit Alma... you're...
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
You know it brother.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
What's with you?
Yeah, it's me.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Who's they?
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Look this is bull...
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Naw... I gotta...
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Can you make a deal with them?
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We need money first...
Wait a second there brother...
Yeah... let me think about it.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
I don't know about that.
What, I don't know how you mean?
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Nothing.
Bullshit...
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
I don't know. I really don't.
Uh... uh... I...
That would be nice.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
Goodbye.
Lovely.
Apology accepted.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
That one is a bit more difficult.
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.
Yes.
It's safer if we stay together.
Father?
What?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
Please.
I stand corrected.
Balderdash!
Long time.
But what about Thomas?
Earned.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
But father, they might come this way.
Is that right, dad?
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
I will. Come and kiss me.
Yaay!
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Yes.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
I'm sure you're not.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Then come on.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Your cairn.
Don't worry about that.
Because it's right.
Wendigo?
This babe has said enough.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
You don't understand--
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Did you see his shirt?
It's beautiful!
I got eggs down here!
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
That's right.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
All right then.
What're you suggesting?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Aye, for us there is.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Thank you, sir.
Then why aren't you eating?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Commodore, you can't do that!
What?
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
More to drink!
Nor did you, I noticed.
Exactly.
We're catching up!
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Smith.
Pirate.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
How?  The key's run off.
Good.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
I'll lead them away.
Jack!
It's the right way.
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
... no.
And no lies!
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
That remains to be seen.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Considering what?
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Thank you, sir.
You don't want this.
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
That's what I thought.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
The nanobot.
We don't?
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
Got it.
No, why?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
Yeah.  Old times.
The nanobot... it's not here...
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
Where is it?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
Oh yes you are!
Yes - Sing Sing.
Dexter.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Of course I am Stewart.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
You can't walk out of here like this.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
Mother!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Thanks, I will.
Oh, man!
Is that so?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
I certainly will.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Yeah?
With me you can always do business.
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
My play.
Sure.
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Oh no, sir!
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you—
I hope you'll be very happy.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Nothing.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Surely, come right in.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
And now for that twentieth crack—
Sure.
Are the cars ready?
I have. Double-strength!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
The name is Smythe.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Very good, sir.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Yeah?
We're in Pleasantville?
Looks just like it did.
Sure.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I won't.
Thanks ... I love you.
I think it looks nice.
But I really should get home.
Yeah. It does.
I was in a bowling-alley.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
With what?
What's the matter?
No it couldn't!
"Changes."
No. What?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Yes I do.
Still doesn't make it right.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
It was accessible to everyone.
Okay--that's enough!
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
As a matter of fact he does.
I don't think so.
Jen please ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Nothing.
Really? It seems so fattening.
... Yeah.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Yes.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
What?
Hunh?
Because we don't belong!
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Just listen to me ...
Why?
... What's that?
Yeah.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
No, that's not it.
Just a little--You know.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
What happened?
Cool.
This is "Fly With Us?"
Ok. Thank you.
Somewhere in Utah.
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Did I say that?
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I'm gonna call you back.
It's not mine.
I have no idea.
Call me later.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Hi, is this Jack?
I'm just laying on my bed.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
Can I ask you a question?
Really? Please?
I need help.
I didn't lie.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
They don't get opened until eight.
Not very well.
Yeah.
Hi.
Are you guys hurt?
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Sure.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Yes.
Ok.
What?
...yeah...
Ok.
Ok.
Yes.
About six months ago. Why?
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
This is funny.
For what?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
What is this?
For what?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Why?
I didn't do it.
Hello, how are you?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
What's that for?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
....I have seven.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Hi, Lance.
You should go on a trip.
So what should I do with the pudding?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Where you goin?
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
You have another house somewhere or something?
What are you doing?
I'm serious.
Seriously.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Are you sure?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Sorry.
You ready?
Ok.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
No.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
At your service, Count.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
"Turn you out?"
Why not?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
That's enough.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Coulmier, you animal!
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
AND DID YOU?
Was it impotence?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
I'm here.
Of course.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
And his writing?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
And I in yours.
But it's just begun --
No, when I was but a tender lad--
I wonder sometimes.
Houdini mice.
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Yes.
I am not that woman.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You will not walk out on me
I will not have this in my home.
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Please don't say this.
Orson. Stop. Just stop
So speaks the court jester.
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
They don't have to.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Uh huh.
Christ.
This ain't George's doing--!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
Yeah, ain't it swell?
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
That's for me to decide.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
The ad..
Then find another theater
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
It was fun, wasn't it?
We done?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
You heard me, I said hit me.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You wasn't with her?
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
You want the title shot or not?
C'mon, Joey.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Where you been?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
So what?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
At night?
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Come here.
Who asked you?
Yeah.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I went to the movies.
OK. Talk.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
But his leg!
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
You think I made all this up?
For instance?
Who left -- where?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Your Lisa?
A possibility.
Like an old hambone?
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
You did.
With that cast on -- you don't.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
I don't know what you mean.
No.
How?
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
I don't want to.
She's all right.
She's just not the girl for me.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Would four of them -- ?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Got a shovel?
There's probably one in the basement.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Empty as a football.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
I wish there was one I wanted.
You mean leave the magazine?
I think it's enchanting.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
What's the apartment house number?
Someone not his wife?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
That's a suitcase?
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Phone number?
A new disease.
What?
Okay.
Down in back.
I think I should go home.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You make any sandwiches?
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
I think I know my son.
He's just loaded, honey.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Look--just relax, will you?
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I'll wait for him.
I just don't want trouble.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Yeah?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Come on!
Who?
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Plato!
Your father!
I'm here.
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
What do you think?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
All right, darling.
Just tell a little white lie?
Grandma?
I don't know why--!
So then you moved?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Yes, ma'am.
Now that's true!
Who lives?
Dig the square wardrobe!
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
Neither can I.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
See, we're very modern.
Hi.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Are you?
You don't need to do that.
What?
We have to go back!
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
I didn't want to stop.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
...whoever she is.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Yeah.
Radio said.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
One more. Smile. One more.
Tell me again.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Beauty and fragrances.
What the fuck is going on.
You're in on this.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Nick...
They all are. Football's on.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You said it a million times!
The hell I can't.
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
I shared his cell!
Yes!
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
Wish I had a brother like you.
What?
Her brother.
Hey.
Five million?
Christmas... Eve...
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
At least gimme video poker.
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
What's the code?
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
I'm no threat without a gun.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
How'd you know my name.
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Mr. Bangs.
Acid-chewer.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
My what?!
I promise you, I didn't know!
Yeah.
Thought you hate your old man.
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
She set them up. All of them.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
What?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
What about?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Dead as Dillinger.
What do you care?
Give me my book.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
How many employees?
No, they're not.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
That's your proof?
Don't ask me that.
Mr. Pink.
He don't believe in it.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
I don't believe in it.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
Why not?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Uh-uh, just cops.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
How can you be so sure?
I think he's just passed out.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
He asked.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
That fuckin did it!
Yeah, those guys too.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Nobody. The light was bad.
Look of things, she doesn't.
And one of 'em is sick.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
As far as -- Sonora?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Hold on.
The who?
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
I suppose that's my fault.
I'm sorry.
I haven't got the job yet.
Hello, Miss Wells.
A man I used to know.
I don't want to run short.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Good thing you didn't.
That's right, Steve.
Nobody asked you to.
I said I didn't care.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
They went on like I told you.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
They shouldn't have done that.
I don't like to see you go.
That's it then.
I don't care what he thinks.
What for?
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
You were supposed to be reading words.
But you're his brother.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Hey, I have an idea...
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Can you feel that?
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Then what are we going to do?
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
I think so.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
Alright, let's take a vote...
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
And sexy.
Yours, or the turkeys?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Then let us prepare.
What?
No, I'm fine.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Get out?! What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
He's really cute!
Jeeezzz!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Always the dentist.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
She sure can pick 'em!
But Mom, the video's not over.
Looks good, Mom!
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
That's right.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
We can be real quiet...
Oooohhhh.
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
...People who don't mind their own business.
I certainly did.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I didn't do it!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
It's sugarless.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
You forgot something...
Yes you are.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
I'd like to get out of here.
You could go and open the door.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
Hello, Frances.
I'll try there.
I guess most people are.
I ought to know.
Weren't you afraid?
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
We could tell him.
I'm afraid.
And then?
Good-bye.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I'm at sea, Jason.
I can imagine.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
I keep telling myself that.
I understand.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
What a peculiar question.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
I'd forgotten.
Tell me what?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
It seems right to us.
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
No. She's no longer under my care.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
I'm very, very serious.
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
I'm afraid not.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Of course.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
What did he say?
When?
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Sister older or younger?
Who's Elizabeth?
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Who's Donna?
You went out with her?
Maybe you want to go.
She said it on her tape.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
It won't. Are you ready?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Why?
No.
And now you can?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Why not?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Possibly.
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Mmmmm...
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
You've made your point.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Yes!
Not very often.
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Radon leakage?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
But he won't.
Well, why?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Cynthia!
Why did you do that?
But why did you want to?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
Did he touch you?
You touched him?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
You are in serious trouble.
No.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Nope.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
No.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
So make an exception.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
She's there? What's she doing there?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
What do you mean?
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
God, you... you're mean.
You were prying before?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
My keys?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
He'll be really mad.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Uh, OK. Sure.
No. I don't think so.
OK. But late.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
What do you want to call me at the office for?
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
Did I say anything?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
You got it!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Who trusts experts?
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
I don't want to get up there.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Sure thing.
Absolutely correct.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Farley!
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
You guys having fun?
Good. That's good.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
So I guess that's it.
Bottle.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
They're just leftovers.
That's on us.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Yeah, Conundrum.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Um... seventy... something.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Now we're talking.
What color is it supposed to be?
When do we get to drink it?
It's not even a mile.
So you're going to stop acting?
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
I want to go home now.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yep.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
You have to tell me --
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
What's up?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
What?
No way. No way.
Quite a week.
I'll pay for it.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Why don't you come in?
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Back at you.
I finished it.
See you.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Try it.
I know. I love that.
How long have you been into wine?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah. Thanks.
Sure.
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Well, nice to see you now.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
About four weeks.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
It tastes old.
She doesn't answer me either.
No dad!
I heard them Morgan.
My ballet recital.
Hi baby.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Yes it was.
Yes, it was.
Yes.
Ray Reddy's house.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
What are you doing?
Me too.
I'm close.
Me too.
Bimboo?
I just asked his name.
You're scaring your sister.
The footprints.
There are none.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
That's why they got you in jail?
Your next water ain't for three days.
Sounds good.
Where were you?
Sure.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
This is a brutal land.
That I do.
I'll be long gone.
Not for five years.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
It's a town...
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
No hard feelings.
Yeah?
Why?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
The other guy drew first.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Let's get out of here.
Howdy.
You're kidding.
Rae, I need help.
Where's Emmett now?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
I just got to town.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
So-called?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
That was my plan.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
Who?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
She'll drive herself.
Better late than never.
You really think so?
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
No.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Thank you.
Excuse me?  Start?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
When is she coming over?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
You never were together, Hal.
Why not?
Simone!
You want me to call Security?
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
You do?
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
This week anyhow.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Really?  Too bad.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
This is the story.
It's a yacht.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Er,... good.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
My God, you've got one?
Is that why she left you?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Yes.  Yes, it is.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
No, just one.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
I forgot myself.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Never mind.
Yes.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
No.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Oh.
Yes.
S-ssssstop it!
How'd he know I'd come?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Alright!
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Someone actually... employs you?
Not lately.
Sorry.
Book of Jeremiah.
Bus broke down.
I could. You sucked.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
"-- an AXE!"
Harvest moonshining!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
I'll be fine here.
"Blood?"
People say he was a murderer.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Amen.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Yeah?
About what?
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Never.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Bill, we need to talk!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
That's not funny.
Oh, yeah?
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Yeah. Good.
Shelby!
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Sorry.
What?
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
All the rib eyes?
Okay.
Grant, no!
Gold--digger, huh?
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
How much style?
You paying for the gas?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Having fun.
Would I lie to you?
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Ciao.
I would've come back for you.
Like what?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
That man is your father?!?
Absolutely.
See ya, Kate.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
But I still don't think...
Running blocker.
Go.
This is Bandit I, come back.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Then don't.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
You okay?
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Go head on, breaker.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
Where the hell are you?
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Mortal.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
You woulda?
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Without peer?
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
I don't see it like that at all.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
A million flat.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
Got hit twice.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Leave the light off.
You're not Gibarian...
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Why did you agree to come here?
Not her.  It.
How quickly?
Yes.
He's dead.
He'll let me in.
Who was it?
That depends.
What was it?
I wish you'd told me.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Just get him to stop.
Her oxygen would have run out.
I'll go with you.
You didn't look very happy.
And tonight?
Rheya.  Not here.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
It's something.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I did too.
You don't know?
I think so.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
Sartorius.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Rheya.
He is.  But he was here...
I want you here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
We want to talk freely.
It's an experiment.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
You didn't like him?
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
Hard to find doors in this place.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
I got money.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
You don't like him, do you?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
What do you want?
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
What?
What are you talking about?
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Oh, some shit.
I'll be right up.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
I heard.
It should've been me...
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I know where everything is.
You stop him?
No, no.
I know.
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Harry…
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Lemme down, bugface!
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Mr. Jameson--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
A spider.  Eight legs.
Well...
Even if they're not clever.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I-- uh--
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Thank God.
I'd never admit that.
Hi, Adele.
I'm sure you kept warm.
What's your problem?
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Aunt May, what happened?
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I don't care.  Cretin.
I will finish what I've begun…
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Static!
Coming up.
In this barracks?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You stink, Sefton!
How much more do we have to take from him?
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
My legs are frozen.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
What exactly is he charged with?
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Some are not bad at all.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Me? What if she don't want me?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
What do they always say?
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Why, sure!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
Good.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
I called it the last time, didn't I?
You told them, Hoffy.
You did!
You can tell Father Murray to --
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Are you questioning me?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Give me the radio.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Ich weiss alles.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
No! No!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Russian women prisoners?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Full disruptors.
Thanks for pointing that out.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Can you project its course?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
One minute to warp core breach.
I hope so, sir.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
What happened to you?
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
And what would that be, sir?
What's normal?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Make it so.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The thought had crossed my mind.
There are no other ships in the system.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
What did you see, Chekov?
Scotty...?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
... Fascinating.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
David --
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
That may be difficult...
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Just him, sir!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
What? What are you saying?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
... A cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.
Go, Sulu!
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.

"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... Yes...
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Yes... But -- how...?
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
That's all you have to say?
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
Ah.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Carol!
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Maybe...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Mother, go back!
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
But we can't just sit here -- !
I saw it -- !
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
Only half of you would get there.
The Admiral's son.
I don't know.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Inoperative.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
KHAN!
Scotty, let's have it.
Give the word, Admiral.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
The word is given: warp speed.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Yes.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
It's all we've got.
Best we could do in two hours.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Yes, sir.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
You earned it.
Energize defense fields.
Who?
Phasers on stun. Move out.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Trying, sir!
Scotty!
Phasers locked...
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Ready, sir.
Honors -- hup!
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Aye, sir.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Yeah.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Please...
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
-- That's the general idea.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Cramps.
... My shoes...
That is what I said, Doctor.
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
... Best shot...?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
How soon?
I buy that. What about him?
What do you mean now?
What's what?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
All right. The truth?
You want the details?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Right.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
A spaceship with a missing man.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
Surely you can be more specific...
What are the variables...?
But you said toxic.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Yes?
Why not?
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
The tank will be finished by morning...
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Thank you, Spock.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Weapons systems?
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
... Aye sir...?
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
On screen.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
How long, Scotty?
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
That's the ticket, laddie.
Sulu Hikaru.
Why?
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
What's the rush?
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I'll be here.
I understand.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Bye.
And our people?
Are they in any danger?
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
I don't know.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
The Ba'ku.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Fail-safe?
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
We're not going anywhere.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
You've not aged a day since then?
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Beam him out!
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Can you beam him off?
But it's comfortable.
Activating injector assembly.
I look forward to reading your report.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
At least four hours.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
No... no, please... you cannot...
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am the Borg.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
I have the password right here.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
<U>Engage.</U>
I'm on it...
Ready.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
Yes.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes, he is.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Some.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
That's impossible.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Onscreen.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Unless you'd like to stay.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Understood!
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
Vulcans sleep lying down...
We DO sleep lying down.
Can you - ?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
If they're even looking for us...
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You feign ignorance?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
How can I trust --
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Yes...
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
I am.
Your honors, the State rests.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Aye, sir; thrusters...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Now we go to Starfleet?
Do we report this, sir?
I like it here...
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Captain, if --
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Sulu!
When does this conference start?
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
They're dying.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
Not yet... Section 4236...
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
I don't want to.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
What?
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Visual!
What is it?
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
Because you are dangerous.
I know.
For how long?
He turned out all right.
Is he very much like you were?
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
That was another time.
To happy endings.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
Now, you make a toast.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
It would appear so.
It'll only work for one of us.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
Of you?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Negative.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
An individual more like you, you mean.

Why is it moving?
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
Thank you.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
What do we know about the planet?
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
Who was it?
A coup d'etat?
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
She's a predator.
Can anything be done for him?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
And the Romulans invade.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
And the Senate supports you?
Yes.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
How did you end up on Remus?
I have no reason to.
There is that.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
You know that's not possible.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
I am.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
What about Picard?
It is... invigorating.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
We're being hailed.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Find her again.
Seven minutes.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
I don't see anything.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Thank you.
I'll have to run your card off now.
Thank you.
Stay right there...
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
It's taken on a disguise.
Oh shit!!!
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Shermin...
No, we don't.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
What?
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Don't... don't do this... please...
Gear shift.
Smile.
Gas good?
You'll see.
I am Jenny Haydn.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
Yes.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
Yes.
I need you.
Do you have a baby?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Go?
What is hell?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Come on.
I must meet my ship.
I can't stay on this planet.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I understand.
I gave you a baby last night.
But...
I know how to gamble now.
If you want to keep it, you can.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
You could have killed us both!!
Call the police!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Sure.
Get Fox.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
It could have been anything.
It was a man though... right?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Yeah, right.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Forget it's there.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Tonight.
We should talk alone.
Step into my office.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Shutup a second!
But this is a bad one.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Okay... what about Strickland?
I won't say anything.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Naawww.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
She never gave me a tape.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Sleaze to peddle.
Define illegal.
Fumitsu.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
She still loves me.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
It's not your fault.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
That's where it gets a little strange.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Fire's out, isn't it?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Uh unh.
Just Lenny.
Are you going to make me beg?
Um... he was older.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
She's buried.
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
You know, you ever think about other women?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
Not bad, huh?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Maybe cause he's smart.
What?
What are you doing?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Huh?, sir.
I didn't use Low's name.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
It explains a lot.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
They're all criminals?
What's this country coming to?
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Don't be too harsh.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
I know.
Sue Ann Hanson.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You did.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Not the way I can.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
No weapon.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
Maybe you should back off.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
[What does the file say?]
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Shuddup.
You're money, baby.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
I'd say about two weeks.
Hi.
Why? You're not a real man?
Tell me about it...
Oh. You know.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
No.
What an asshole.
Sorry?
You want this in black chips.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Listen. I had a great time.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...It's really getting late.
Fine... I guess. You?
Yeah?
What kind of things?
I heard you might be moving back...
It sucks.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
It's a gig.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
What do you want? You're tall.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
What'd you get?
Classy.
I just tested for one...
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
Go for it, man.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
He's trying to be an actor.
...People get carjacked...
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Hang on, Voltaire.
S'up Trent?
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What?
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas!
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
You think they're watching?
I know, but...
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
What?
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Aww... He got away?
They're a finesse team...
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
You think?
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
Be smart about it.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Yes. 
I ask for Justice.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Understood.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
Sure.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
For bravery.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
No.
How?
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
Okay.  One minute.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
An accident.  No one was hurt.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Mama, no.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Thanks Tom.
How will they come at you?
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Who is he?
Michael...
And what do you want for Christmas?
I'm thinking about it.
OK. 
Goodbye.
I'm busy.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
How's Mom?
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
Thanks.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
What are you doing in Mongi?
You just woke up!
Is that good?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
It's vile.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Oh, it was.
Okay.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
What?
What?
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Relax.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
Really? To Italy?
Oh God, I don't think so.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What evening?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Dickie?
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Such as?
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
What about Cortina?
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
I think you're right.
Marge, when did you get here?
Dickie did it.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
What?
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
What?
Okay then, you're crazy.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
I'll fix some drinks.
I'm fine.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Even your fiancée...?
November 7th is my information.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
Oh. Who was that again?
What's wrong?
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
Thank you, Travis.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
With who?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
Ouch!
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
A real skunk.
One-Ball McCall?
A girl needs protection.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I don't like my real name.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Oh, come off it, man.
That's not hard to do.
Where is home?
He shoots dope too.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
What's going on?
Hey Wizard.
You want to talk about it?
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
It's all I could think of.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
I am, too.
I wish you were coming with me.
Damn...
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Well...
You mean,  me?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Nothing.  
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
I... I need a drink of water.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Good to meet you.  Again.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
Who... are they?
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes?
Dad, I...
... what?
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Did you... did you...
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
No, sir.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Aren't you coming?
Can we get him to the hospital?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Why not?
So, it is a blacklist.
It's wrong, Leo.
Luke didn't smoke.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
When was that?
I taught you that.
What exactly did you hear?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Yes.  Very.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes?
I think so.
What do you mean?
When was this?
Different?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Then go.
Take them.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Is she all right?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Try my best.
Right across the bay there.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Impossible.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
Birds are not bad!
They're back!
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Yes.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
I'm sorry, Mitch.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
If they are?
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Do I sound foolish to you?
Yes.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Yes.
Lovebirds.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
What made it...
Criminal.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Yes?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Oh. That. Rome.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
No.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Helping travelers.
What'll it say?
Yes.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
So they united.
Hear!
With my little sparrow leading team.
After the gulls attacked.
...everything I know.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
Don't let's take any chances.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Yes.
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Do you have any lovebirds?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
That would hardly be possible.
Then let's go. Now!
Good.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
It is a pity.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Well? And are you not a good student?
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
Pulse?
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Why, yes.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
I've had some experience.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
The heart pumps it.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
I know --
Yes.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
Aye --
You can get out.
Where are they?
Yeah. I sure will.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
Nobody.
I was talking about you.
I told you, I knew your sister.
Yeah, I know.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
It's what Lauren would do.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Could say that.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
I do. Every day.
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
Not tonight. Honest.
Just hold on to me.
Honey. I just can't.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Looks like you have them both on.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
Yes -- that is true.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
I assure you such power exists.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Of course, dear.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
Come on in.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Yes--?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Who?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
They would have killed this man?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
We don't ride with vampires.
Time to activate Plan B.
Zero.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Hit the lights again.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Lots more where he came from.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Did we have a date tonight?
This is Michael.
No.  Just you.
I like Michael.
He's just a deep sleeper.
No.  I'm up.
Okay.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
I hope so.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
No... no, everything's different now...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Nowhere.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Piss off.
Huh?...
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Let's load 'em.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Maybe.
So what's our problem?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Don't walk behind me.
Now hold on, you dumb...
If it did get to him.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Cut him loose?
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
Probably the next meal.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Come on, Copper.
I think so.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Little over two hours.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
I ain't going with Sanchez.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
MacReady, that you?
MacReady...?
On the towers?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
I'm used to that.
No...
Vox...
I'll never forget this.
I will...
Alexander.
Created?
As slaves.
How?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
A man can change his history.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Got here as soon as I could.
What?
I need to... um... talk to you.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Let them.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Perseverance.
For God's Sake, David --
I would.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
Good night, Alex.
His home.
Sir...?
I don't understand.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Thank you...
You can see so many here.
Good night.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
We all have that dream.
We share everything.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
What are you?
Orion's belt...
Go back to your own time?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
New Yorkers.
No...
Why?
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
Depends on what you're seeing.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
You may have known my father, William Starks.
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Mom, he just fixed our car.
You two ok?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
Well, you belong in one.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
How?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Yes.
I know.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
They're not.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
I could try to...make it stop.
Why?
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Maybe.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Don't you go to jail for that?
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
So what am I supposed to do?
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
Where are you going?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No, I'm ok.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
[Beat] I do it.
I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
Yes, baby?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You girls are in some hot water.
You want to come on in?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Tell us about him.
It's him.
A .38.
My Lord.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Yes.
So this is all my fault, is it.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Give me the keys.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
It's probably not a good idea.
What did Darryl say?
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Why not?!
What.
You're right.
Now what what?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
I can see that.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
About how fast was I going?
Hit it.
I believe you.
Just asking.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
What do you mean?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
It's grand!
What are you talkin' about?
You got that right.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
You sent that?
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
He implied it.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Well... at least now you know.
Uh-huh.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Jesus Christ you're right.
You got a brew?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Am I?
Who the fuck is it to you?
You found my car?!
Nepal? Have you been?
I already know it, Mary.
Great.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
You're a movie buff?
Have you seen it?
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
-- Love story of our time.
Huh... that's strange.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
No.
Three different guys?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Good good.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Bullshit!
And you met Mary how?
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Four.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
Hm?
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Healy.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Huh?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Oh yeah.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Yeah?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
All right, let's go.
You got what stuck?
What?! No please, sir --
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
What do you mean?
I wasn't trying --
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
So what's up?
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Giddy-up.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Tomorrow...
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
Then you'll call, right?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We've got bigger problems right now.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
What does the letter say?
-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
Smoke.
Yes it is.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
You're sure...
Okay, Ken. We're going.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Just a second, Mr. President.
You're my hero, Carl.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Good. Thank you.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
How'd you know?
That's right.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Bullshit.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
And...
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
What'd you expect to hear?
Cuz you're a cop.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
We're in there. We're in there --
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Good.
Leavenworth a tough joint?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
How the hell do you know?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Yeow!
You let me make a fool of myself.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Um. You.
I'm special.
Uh hum.

You always get what you want?
Where'd you get it.
What do you want?
How does it go?
That's three.
How could you?
Yes sir!
Remember one thing.
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
These guys are getting on my nerves.
You.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
No! Now we're inverted!
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
What do I want?
Got you here.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
I've had enough...for now.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
We did it.
Nope.
Is that how you remember it?
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Or....
I know.
I'm nothing like him.
He was by the book, all the way.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Why not?
Take me to the hotel.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Thank you.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Come on...put his head in place.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
You tell me.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Up to the right.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
What is it?
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Split up.  Find him.
Come on!
How did I get in this taxi?!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
But I'm always home by morning.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Some men just tried to kill me!
You went to those brain butchers?!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
What's he talking about?
I love you.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Jump!
I used to model for 'em, why?
Oh, since when?
The one in the mine!
Aliens built it.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I gave you?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Some kind of mutation...?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Cannon fuse.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Well, who put you two in charge?
Hell you did.  Your turn.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Why?
Well, sure.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Sons of bitches!
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
We got a plan!
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
What?
You are so full of shit...
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
You bet.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Val.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
LET'S DO IT!
And one good guy.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
True.
Correct.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
I have to talk to your brother.
Sustained.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Can't I take a simple piss without --
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Of course.
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
You really think that's what happened?
-- Yeah?
I feel much better now.
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
Roger Baron.
1530 Rivington Street.
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
...For ten years, now.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
That's right.
"No," what?
It was self-defense.
Shu Kai Kim.
That's right.
Objection.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
Shouldn't one of us...?
-- What trial?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
That's right.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
Albert.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Here he comes.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Bobby...
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Thank you, Carl.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
An old woman and her grandson.
Yep, it sure is.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
Oh.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Smell something fishy, huh?
Stanley, I heard all about it.
Any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
I don't know, Sam.
I think that's a good idea.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
When?
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Well, why not?
Donna, are you my best friend?
No, I want to smoke.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Donna, you are a muffin.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
No, you should forget about last night.
What can I tell you?
I can't help you there.
Who would do that?
Hey, Jacques...
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Not now.
I can't tonight.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
What?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
...school's fine...
Dad...
A friend from school.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Yes.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
And no one will know the truth.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
I wouldn't do it.
No.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
I know of him.
Through, through his book.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
I am seventy-four years old.
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Well...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes? Galvin, right?
Right. Who called?
You're going to settle out of court?
Her doctors killed her.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
...that's perfectly all right.
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes.
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.
Ready, your Honor.
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Yes. It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Maybe what?
I've got to work.
I... do you want me to leave?
And what makes you so tough?
Stop pressuring me...
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
No.
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...fifty thousand dollars?
...I understand...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Thanks, Franky.
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
What do you want?
Don't touch anything.
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Yeah. I'm awake.
...one of the other nurses?
Yes.
Should I?
Huh.
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
I liked him.
It was...  ...one of them!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
Right.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
It's always been a good persuader.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
It was nearer than that.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
No biggie, really.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Like what?
Heather, has there been another call?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
I'll be there in three hours.
No.
Absolutely.
Oh my God...
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Bye.
Finish, please!
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
The mean old man with the claws.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Home, that's right.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Here.
A story?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
What are you talking about?
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Your father?
You miss him.
He knows.
I haven't forgotten.
Claiming their place in the world.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Yes, Sir.
I didn't know sir.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
What?
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Figured what out?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
Like this!
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
Yes sir.
He killed the dolphin.
Of what?
They have every right Chuck.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Twice.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
I can take care of myself.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
Yes sir.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
They'll know about it in the morning.
She's Cuban.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
You know what he is talking about here?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Joy, rapture...
What?
Aaauuuhhh!!!
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
How old are you?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
No, haven't heard of it.
You an indian?
When did you talk to Lula?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
...Asshole.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
You ain't actin', mama.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Peanut...
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
What's that?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
What'd you say to her?
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What kinda trash talk is that?
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
It's just another case, Sailor.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You certain?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
You do.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Uh huh.
Under a hundred.
That'd be good, Lula.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
What's that?
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
You sick?
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Oughta make 'em happy.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
What?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What makes sense, is all.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Santos...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Whattya mean?
Life is unpredictable.
Well?...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
So I hear.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
She left me. Crabs.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Tripp.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Maybe... I don't know.
What's to tell?
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
Do you know he won't expel him?
I peeked.
Excuse me?
You must be mistaken.
You did.
How long have you been having them?
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
Shoot.
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Yea?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Like the lady herself.
Yea, James.
You?
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
What's he saying?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Sure.
What'd he say?
What'd you tell him?
That's a big book you're writing.
Blocked.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
So where have you been staying?
Hm.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Yeah, well, actually...
Your aunt?
Glaucoma?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
I didn't mean it that way.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
I think so... What about you?
James'll know about George Sanders.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Oh. Well. I...
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
All right. This morning --
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Caps.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Grady.
He told me.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Dozens. It's very sad.
Some times...
It didn't come up.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
It's Grady, Walter.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
Why did you come here, Grady?
Give me a break, Grady.
Just a few then. The big ones.
You want to keep him happy.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Something wrong with that?
I like the noise.
It's a nice table.
Next week? The week after?
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
In that birch tree is a nest.
It's hard to describe.
You live around here?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Why don't you just tell me?
Got something to hide?
You can't talk to me like --
Okay.
What?
Woodsman?
It's a free country, isn't it?
It gives me headaches.
You are in.
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Do you have many friends?
They sound like finches.
Do you like it when he asks you?
What will happen if I do?
I know because... it's just something I know.
Robin, listen to me.
The job's okay.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
What?
Of course.
Bad idea.
Reflect.
You think reflection is good.
How's that?
I'm still thinking about it.
I don't need someone else.
I don't feel anything.
Have to talk about something.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
We have a lot of work to do.
I'm afraid not.
I don't.
What did you think would happen?
I want to talk about it now.
I'm relaxed.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
Nothing.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
I'm all right.
What?
I'll buy a plant.
I like the noise.
Yeah, they could.
What?
It's been a while since...
Maybe later.
The morning?
I molested little girls.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
What did you do to them?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
What?
Why young girls, Walter?
I know.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
You must hate your brothers.
No you don't.
Live together.
Fine.
What's it look like?
I'm not scared.
What's your fucking problem?
Nothing.
Do you want to talk about it?
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
No.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Calm down, Bud.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Why bring it here?
I can't... make it... podner.
You watch yourself.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Wait for what?
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
Well, what?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
And why haven't they left each other?
No.
And how do you explain that?
Yes.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Are you joking?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Why?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I deserve it.
No.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
But for what reason should I come there?
I detest comparisons made with oil.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Unfortunately, no.
From Panarea. Why?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
They didn't seem too good.
You know, I don't love anybody.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
He talked to you Himself?
Agnes...
That's not what he meant.
Who?
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Dear Jesus...
It made them holy.
That wasn't me.
Right now?
I love you.
Yes.
In the confessional.
Why should they?
Did it hurt?
And what happened?
And then what?
Where'd it come from before that?
Agnes...
Martha Louise Livingston.
No.
I can't have them any more.
What?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Where did you go?
No.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
No...
She can.
She...
... makes me...
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
And then...
Alright.
No I'm not.
No I'm not.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Because I'm in trouble.
I can't tell you that.
She made me promise not to.
I'm afraid.
Are you ill?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Go away, I don't want you here.
Yes.
Why?
Where?
Who?
Agnes, who did this to you?
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
I put her to sleep.
Thanks...
If I find anything I'll call you.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Who are you?
How do you survive?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Yes... I...
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
That possibility never occurred to you?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
And you weren't shocked?
And what happened?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
Then help her.
Aquittal.
Because I didn't know... 
Yes I do.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Of course.
How  ?
Where is she?
Is it because she's a nun?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
She didn't want any help.
That's a lie.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Then she's a liar.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Are you now?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
I'm a deserter, too.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Bag-snatcher.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Of course I can.
I'll have a bash.
I don't care.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Yes.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Why selfish?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
See you.
Out where?
Books are good!
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Nothing good.
What's he on about?
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Here, Pauly.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Don't be callous.
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Ah, go on, you swine.
We were going to do it.
Sit down, the lot of you.
You wouldn't!
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Is it? Is it really?
I knew I could rely on you.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Don't start. Look.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Someone put it on me.
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
But John hasn't got any.
Clever.  George.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Cattle ranch!
Kill drive engines.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Dell, plot our location.
Where the hell are we?
Then take her down.
But functioning.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
A voice transmission.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Right.  Talk to you.
Yeah!
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Dead.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
The water will still recycle.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Poison gas...
No, I don't want us separated.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
How's Broussard?
How do we locate the creature?
Don't be an idiot.
It's time for drastic remedies.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I'm trying.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
We can use the flamethrower.
Feast your eyes.
You lead.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Let's let the machine work on him.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
Let's get moving with this net.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Engine room, what happened?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Who gets the privilege?
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Sure.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Too many.
Shit.  When?
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
But...
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Yeah?
What?
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Yeah, I...
It's alright, it's cool...
Thanks.
Where does that lead to?
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Well... try the headset.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Eddie...
Just some coffee.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Why'd call me a killer?
What else?
I'm in love with Lloyd!
You have no right to say such things!
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
And too many of them are produced.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Eve! My understudy...
Of course I knew.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
Thank you so much.
Show me a human and I might have!
As of this moment you're six years old...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
See you...
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Don't calm down.
Here we go...
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
What would you like? Texas?
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
Is that what you want me to be?
From what would I be running?
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
No thanks, Birdie.
Of course!
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Well?
Night an' day.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
What for?
Subway.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Oh, no. I see the play.
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
I won't forget.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
There can't be very much-
I'm not crying.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
There are other plays...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Why not?
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
You've what?
Harrington.
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
What about Bill?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
I just can't believe it.
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
That was a pity...
That's quite a change of subject.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
I mean really, deeply angry...
I just played it.
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
Would you?
Answer my question!
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
Let me lay a little theory on you--
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Hmm.
--a spy, you mean?
About the past year.
--fifteen phone calls--
Why didn't we get that?
--you do?--with access to records?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
You're not a kid anymore.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
And I'm a Republican.
--Colson.
If he self-destructed.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
Only everything...
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
And you will.  But not now.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
You can't.
I've got a lot of energy.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--so?
--that was awhile ago--
We've just been talking to Young--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
--what?--
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
What do you want to know?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Mitchell knew then.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
It may never come out.
Nobody ever had too much.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Could develop.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
Absolutely.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
No, none of those.
Sorry.
You need some work, buddy!
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Seduce her.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
You can call me Ostreicher.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
That's nice.
What?
Sure.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm not playing.
What's that?
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
But that one time --
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Pontificated.
Yeah, sure.
Do you know about the clitoris?
It's not what it looks like!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
I told you.
Don't you want me to?
Okay!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
You've got something going?
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well...uh...
Move with the music.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
You want to do it?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, right here.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Once, in church, dude.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Observe.
He didn't?
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Fuck yeah we will.
Doing what?
No way.
Uhh! Would you die already!
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
A la votre.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Yeah. French fries...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Well, they are French.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Shit!
You'll never get the chance.
And you call me a moron...
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Oh shit... No...
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Why the fuck would I do that?
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
How well did, er, do you know him?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Yes sir.
Merde.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
How to read.
I know, but I had to because . . .
When you're older . . .
Who's Sophie?
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
Who are you?!
What happened to your parents?
I have my reasons.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
I was all out of dynamite!
Trying... to... breathe...
You are the Princess.
It's the best fork of all
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Don't be
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Is it? Is this what you want?
Bartok... a question.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Pray he's color-blind...
Ah! Let us begin!
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
What do you mean?
Watch me.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Young	man, I...
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
This guy's on television.
What?
M'mm.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Alvy.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Tsch.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
You-you play... very well.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Wisconsin.
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah, I know.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
It's terrific.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh.
As Balzac said...
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
H'm?
U-huh.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Of course.
You don't want me to live with you?
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
U-huh.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Following is different. I was spying.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Who cares? Who cares?
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
M'hm.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Sinatra?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
No.
Yeah.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Oh. What?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
It's for my complexion.
I don't know.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Oh! My God! 
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Yeah.
I'm cool.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Oh-
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
I'm late.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Step up here!
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Don't get upset!
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
It's a narrow view.
You're crazy!
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Right, Max. California, Max.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
She was going through my pocketbook!
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
I just have time to get the, uh-
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Hey-
I was a great beauty.
Oh yes.
Would it make a difference?
You're fucking desperate.
Why last?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
It's alright, isn't it?
Not this time.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Why would she care?
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
I love her too, Joe.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
You really need to be fucked.
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
She's in ICU.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Let me heal you, baby.
A perfect night.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
I don't think so.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Fantastic.  Out here.
I adore him.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Did you invite them?
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Beats a lawsuit.
Happy anniversary.
Hardly...
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
We're great.
For good.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Well he can't have gone far.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Don't do this!
You're not ready.
Everybody hates the messenger.
I'll be with you.
Me too.
Me too.
It's a Calder.
Oh, Sally Mae...
Will you make love with me?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Hm.
Elitism?
And you know, he really does not.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
I will treasure this.
And he doesn't smoke?
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Trust him.
Not good.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Why?
Don't go in, Ryan.
Yes.
Oh?
Oh?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Very.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
I guess.
Would you like to meet my husband?
A notch above the storage room.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Why are you doing this?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
You -- you think I'm right?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Yes.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Hlllllllp!
Oh no...
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Superior numbers, kid!
Don't get all sappy about it!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
So...you two are in love?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
My mother.
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Sheldrake?
Oh!
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Good night.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
What time does the show go on?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
How is your cold?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
How come?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
I think so.
The mirror -- it's broken.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
You don't want me here --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Someone from the office.
In his apartment.
I mean -- her apartment.
They had to pump it out.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Gin.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I just want some fresh air.
Who'd care?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
A what?
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
Over a girl?
Where?
In the knee?
What?
Oh.
That's very wise.
I'm fine all over.
Of course not.
Seven --  -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Gas?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's very flattering.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Relax, Baxter.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
No.
Good night.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Come on, Fran.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Important?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I love you -- remember?
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Yeah, we better.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Atlantic City?
Baxter?
He wouldn't.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
It won't happen again.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
See if they'll what?
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Dreadful.
My men --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Part.
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Call me what, sir?
No shit.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
Let's go.
Who knows what's up there?
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
We're Americans.
When'd you do it?
What is it?
Too far inland.
Would he remember you ?
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
Charlie?
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
They must have seen the fire.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
This gentleman or myself ?
Do you know that jungle?
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Who knows.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
You can't have water after morphine.
How's the pain?
Oh Captain, that is so true.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
You knew him best.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Why didn't he shoot you?
And shut up.
I should be checking on the boat.
No. Not really.
Yes.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Right now -- I am.
Anyone got a card?
Son of a bitch, sir.
139  CONTINUED:
150  CONTINUED:
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
26   CONTINUED:  
Six months.
-- Corbett's a killer.
Why?
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
That's my line.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
I'm staying.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
New to the country, kid?
Yeah.  Maybe so.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
-- Turn around.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
Forget it.  It would take days.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
I'm here to do my job.
You don't get it, do you?
Where's my ELT?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Nothing personal.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Emergency room only.
Will you please take it?
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Okay.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
What's with the dark?
My son is sick, okay?
Carol the waitress?
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Two days.
Are you still coming?
Fries.
Yeah... Well...
Were you asleep?
Were you asleep?
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Yes. I really would.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
No. No. Get Carol.
What are you trying to do to me?
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Think white and get serious.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
What?
Wait here.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
What's he look like?
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Do you realize that I work at him?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Where are all your queer party friends?
Get out.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
I'm going back with you.
Another place where?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
I forgot to lock the door.
What's it mean?
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Just a second -- he has to go.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
So you're from around here?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
How long have you been freelance?
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
What?
Why don't you tell me.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Bain!
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
I'm worried about you, Robert.
I know.  It was a joke.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Yeah?
Turn off the engine.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
Just Electra?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Jesus -- why?
The exotic women.
Then you went freelance?
Are they usually like that?
After that?
Where is it?
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Fine.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
We split the money?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except --
For Nicholai?
What?
Why?
I'm sure you will.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
What?
Okay.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Electra --
Sometimes.
All the time.
A dime.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
What did the beer cost?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
We could make a run for it?
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Can you do the lock on it?
Is it gone four-thirty?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
We don't speak Czech!
No, not yet.
What?
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
I'm not hungry, really.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
What are you talking about?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
No!
Do you know the way?
That one?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
So am I.
That's my mum's.
No!
Regards to Her Majesty.
What?
What? You are crazy!
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
No.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
I hope so!
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
It's not so much.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
How?
No, it should be over soon.
I had it coming from someone.
Hmm, I still owe him.
No!
Not all of them!
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Maybe it is!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
What for?
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Very well.
I'll tell her you were here.
I'm sorry about how we --
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
About a job.
He wants to talk to you.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Scamming's a strong word.
Later.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
-- This play means a lot to me.
Like me.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
You don't believe in anything?
Yes. And?
Healthy as can be.
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
You're sometimes not sure?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Not possible.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
No.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I will.
I used to like yogurt.
Better. I was really angry.
It was a play.
Ever again.
I'd do that --
For pay?
Then you remember more than I do.
I didn't say you did.
Scalene?
But he didn't ask me.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Run out of gas?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Oh, right, right... 
Then where the hell is he?
Precisely! 
Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
We don't....
You were ringing the doorbell!
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Jesus!
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Dick? Dick who?
No way!
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
He said not to tell.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
He never bit me.
They're okay.
Sure thing. Come on.
Is that right?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
It's okay.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Sure.
Well, stop the world.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Yeah.
I don't want a steak.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
No.
Just thinking.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Just gimme a chance.
Beats me.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
To get my guns.
Don't shoot!
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Everybody okay up here?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
You don't wanna know.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Go where?  Where're you going?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
I didn't drop 'em.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
No!  Ditto the professor-
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Really?...
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
What DID you mean?
What else?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Well... actually, no Bill...
Well I...
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
He's a great writer –
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, you just... sound a little–
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Charlie. How are you.
Seen a doctor?
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
That's all right, really –
...Yeah, okay.
Hi, Charlie.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
No... no...
Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
...Both maybe?
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Mr. Lipnik.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Must be.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
The others are being sent.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
All of which he's now missin'.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Give you nose bleeds?
Excellent picture.
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
It's been three months.
She said what you said she'd say.
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
Put your hands up!
I don't smoke.
It won't last.
I have nothing to hide.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I loved him.  I hurt.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Don't get too cocky.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I'll meet you there.
She's seen everything before.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Did you like her to watch?
Make love to me.
I never have before.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I don't know.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Did you miss me?
Come over here and tell me no.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
He was murdered.
How's that?
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Somethin', though.
I went over last night, too.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
You don't like punk rockers?
Why the hell not?
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Yeah.  I know.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Are you vice?
He was shot.
Do you ever get sick of it?
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
It's in New Jersey.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
You want a drink?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
I didn't see you.
I hate this. Turn that off.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
You mean like an ape?
Yes, but as a black painter –
Not black.
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Really?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
SAMO.
Hi Gina.
Come on in!
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Basquiat, what did you take?
Staten Island would be ok.
You're your own baby.
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
Hi.
Stand still.
Have a Mac.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's."  You --
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
Yes and no...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Your blood, Max.
One way to find out?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Silent night, violent night...
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Too late for what, dear child?
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfred's happy here.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Can he save her?
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
Maybe he melted.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Where is my wife?
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Our work?
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Why, indeed?
What?
What?
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Recognition, of course.
Enigma.
Big house. How many rooms?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Slanta.
Banzai.
Not much.
Excuse me.
And now....
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I don't want to remember!
What?
Excuse me.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Bruce, you can't.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
What the hell is going on here?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Let's see if you bleed green.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
What are you talking about?
I know. I called them.
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
No one would miss me.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you talking about?
What are you, scared of heights?
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
What?  I improved her a little...
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Allie, he's not.
He's not crazy.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
Hi.....  Roses.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Ahm.....
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Well, Ahm....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Yes, isn't he.
Great news.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Quite right, sir.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Great, good.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Of course he is.
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Me first!
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Ah, the witness?
Cut the power!
Deep and hard.
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
That's better. Yes?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Agent Hurley...
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
We're rich in what really matters.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Won't?  Or can't?
That's my girl!
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Just a hunch.
Is this like a trick question?
Really.  I don't know.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
No.  What's wrong?
We tried.
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
No, wait!
No, Lydia, we're dead.
Step... mother.
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
And live in what, our station wagon?
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Just <u>say</u> it.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
You've got to help them.

It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Delia hates it.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
It wasn't a joke.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
Viridian?
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
I don't know.
The attic.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
Oh, fine.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
No.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Thank you, Robert.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
There's no need for a hospital.
Yes. I am.
No. I'm a gardener.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Yes.
Our greenhouse.
Thank you, Eve.
No, thank you.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Thank you, Eve.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
I like to watch.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Hello, Morton.
I don't want Robert.
I agree.
Yes. I am very hungry.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Yes, Ben - he is.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
No, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
I want to tell Eve.
I can't read.
What sort of bed is it?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Yes. It is.
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes.
I hope so.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
... Hello.
Yes, I will.
Try again.
Try again.
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Yes, ma'am.
It's not that, I just...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Look, Johanna...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Right, Chief.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Yes, I did.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Okay.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
The monkey.
Hi.
Right.
Yeah. You want a beer?
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
What's that?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
What's that?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Simulates?
That... was... no... simulation.
Yes?
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Sure. It'd be fun.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
You're evil, Maxine.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Says who?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
I have to see you.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Whatever you're having.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Do you mind?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, Lotte...
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Then what do I do?
Well what?
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
Yes?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
I don't. I have my own.
Yes ma'am..
In case of what?
Extra?
That was fun.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Go upstairs I said!!
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
I don't want to know.
She was only-
Who is she? Where she come from?
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
All he can. All he can.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
She left me. She's gone again.
Yes sir.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Oh, nothin', you know.
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
I'm going home, Donny.
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
That fucking bitch!
What the fuck is he talking about?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
I'm shomer shabbas.
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Far out.
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Color?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
What's your drink, Dude?
On you, maybe.
Yeah man.
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Oh?
Uh-huh.
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
But he's--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Huh?
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Huh?
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Whose toe was it, Walter?
No, I'm--
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Dude?
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
What's your point, Dude?
What the fuck are you talking about?
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
Come on, Walter!.
No Dude.
Dude, I'm sorry--
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Walter!
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
This is a league game, Smokey!
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
What?
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
I want to see the sun rise.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Either that or feeding the worms.
I don't like it.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Too bad you're out of it.
I don't know about this, man --
He was here.  Watching us.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
How do I stop it?
He didn't. Get over it.
How can you tell?
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Blade --
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
Some. It's been slow --
I'm not leaving without you.
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
For them. But for me --
There's only one alternative to the serum.
What about the chemistry panel?
What?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Join the club.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Trying to find the energy.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Mrs. Leavitt--
Let's talk to your husband--
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
--Nick!!
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
--fine, later, fine.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
We've looked at half of one tape.
No.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I can't.
Whatever you want.
I can't let you in.
What? That made her lose the baby?
--go!
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
No.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Butt-ugly owl.
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
No one ever comes here.
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
I am.
I'm not finished.
Asleep--
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Enough to keep sane.
One of the printers.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Ancient runes--
--and we brought it back with us!
--no.
What'd you say?
....I don't know.
That's why she kills children.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Who <u>is</u> this??
Yes.
I am?
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Meurice--
Your husband.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
You're bad.
I said you're bad.
...What do you mean?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Isn't that what you want?
I think someone's watching.
Thanks.
I don't follow baseball.
About ten years.
Uh-huh.
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
It's not strictly legal.
So it would seem.
Of course.
Nah, I trust ya.
Has Ray come in yet?
What's the point?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
What's that?
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
You did? A human ear?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes.
Yeah.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Only you. and the photo lab.
. my bourbon.
. mommy's here.
If you want to.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Nobody.
Never before this.
Yes.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
No. please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
What?
O.K.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Hello.
That's good.
I'm doing it.
Whatiya mean?
Beeeee careful.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Do you love me?
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
They hurt his head.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
What?
Nothing.
Okay Frank.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Where are they?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I don't know.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Alright.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Oh, okay. can I call?
Yeah.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
What is it?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
... You look beautiful.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
uh uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
This is it.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Do you want the car?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Yeah.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Okay.
Where do you guys want to count?
He what?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
What is?
You'll see for yourself.
You happy, baby?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Excuse me?
What?  Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
No.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
What?
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Now do you see what I am saying?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
I just got released five minutes ago.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
No more brothers, Diego.
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Mom.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Dad.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That was a beautiful message.
What about him?
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.
Are we gonna split up?
Dad.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
I'll be here.
You swear?
It's alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Yes, I do.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
And you believe the NLF?
Dien Bien Phu?
Second district ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Third group.
It's true.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
Sure. By shooting at me.
I don't even know your name yet ...
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
Not enough.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
A name?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
How can I give you this statement?
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Why?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
The official cause?
No.
Increase his heart rate.
Like cats and dogs.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
You get his statement?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
No -- but I can get it for you.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I had a bad heart.
I had bypass surgery.
She didn't.  She just left.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
No.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
Chinese peony root.
Yes -- he did.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Because he called me.
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
It's not my taste.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
It won't be that hard.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
You take a lot for granted.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
I went out on the boat.
Honey.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
That wasn't the deal.
Shoot him.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
She's waiting in the conference room.
I love you too, Dad.
-- But it's Sunday.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
No, Your Honor.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
You better.  Please answer the question.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
We have to talk.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Daddy -- stop it!
Oh Jesus.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Aw, Betty.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
'82.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
You're right -- that is sick.
They got heat in Michigan.
Heat is heat.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
I don't mind waiting.
No, your kids.
Must be nice having kids.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
You get used to it.
You want to go back in?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No. But I love them just the same.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I want you to come.
Oh, how is he?
Why?
Nobody's asking you to.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
I had a temper.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
No.
What?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
Yeah. It could get better.
But now that you have it -
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Hmm?
WHAT!
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Just some flies.
Spooked?
Climb out to where?
That's some terrible shit.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Bill!  Bill?!
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
What building?
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
Not that I remember.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
No thanks.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
You want to get into this now?
All right!  Where's the key?
Where's what?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
Yeah, I know.
No!
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
It was him.  I'm positive.
All right, Caesar.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Where, then?
Just hurry.
Not until he has the money!
You betrayed me!
I'm listening.
Yes, I understand.
Sure, Gino, sure.
It's all right, sir.
Lick me.
Are you okay, Violet?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
How do I know you are cops?
All right.
Good guess.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Not exactly.
Sure.
A beer.  Of course.
Why?
Tell me about it.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
I guess I wanted to.
I'm not afraid of anything.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Mickey?
For what?
Is that what you think?
Does the case lock?
Yeah.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
He won't.
If he does ...
Not Caesar.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
I'm still here.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
Hey.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
I think everything is okay.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
-- sir? --
Really.
Okay.
It's a little late for that.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
You have blood on your pants.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
That's it?  Is that it?
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
No.
I didn't know this would happen.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
xxxxxx
Not really.
I'm sorry.
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
Enhance it.
-- I'm on it --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
What have you done to my flat?
...elephoned sir.
Got there!
It's reply paid.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Layton.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Well, I ...
Well ... well, I ...
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Jack!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
You sound worried.
Even later.
What is it?
Am I?
Not really, no.
You killed him?
So how ...?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
What?
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
If you say so.
It's you ... it's you ...
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Well, no system is.
Well, all wars do -
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Who will?
"And your children all gone."
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Your face ... are you hurt?
Don't do anything silly.
What a BITCH!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
You haven't switched it on.
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
You're not listening, mother.
Mother!
Actually, I've decided ...
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
I know, I know ...!
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No, sir.
Numero, trois.
Central Services.
We'll be back.
Emergency procedures.
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
She say she in great pain.
You can trust me on this one.
We are virgins.
Mary said you might be coming.
I should be going. I just quit.
Just take it easy.
Dead.
No.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
He's going to be all right, right?
No way, man.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
What did you say?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
His heart's beating.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Yes.
Yes.
You look so different.
How is she?
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
Maybe I should come up with you.
No, no.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Thanks.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
What's wrong.
What's that, Frank?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Crazy fucker.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
I've taken that into consideration.
How's he doing?
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Who with?
Why?
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Okay, whatta I do?
That's ridiculous.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
You're burned out.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Relax, will you.
You really think so?
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Yeah.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
What?
No?
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Why?
A half hour in the lobby.
Call if you get weird.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Not because you have to.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Good.
They're not that dumb, after all.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Then it went well.
No.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
No!!!!!
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Speaking.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Really?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
You didn't say anything to her?
Wipe me out?
So I quit.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
Nobody else had it.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
They fired me.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
No.  Not even you.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Yes, sure.
So great -- right?
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
Hey?
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Okay.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Why, you need me for the story?
Uh-uh.
Great.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Because you're nuts.
Well, when?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
Then you should stay here.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Go ahead -- what?
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm going home!
I already told you I'm not.
It wasn't easy.
Oh...
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Here here...
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
That means you like me!
Carla -
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Yeah, right outside the door!
Well I was uh, just looking...
Enough already about it - get to work!
Well...
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Turn around!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Why not?
What do you get?
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I was just straightening up the place.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
What's the matter with you!
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
Let's move out!
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Amazing!
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Yeah, I guess.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Didn't you get my message?
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Yeah?
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Merrick...
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
Like my homework.
Why don't we see a movie?
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
I know.  I like your little outfit.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
She --
Our purposes.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Who we gonna beat?
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Oh.
Fine.
Don't start with me again.
Buffy...
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
That's the plan.
I guess.
Thanks.
I'm just a girl.
Got that.
No --
I heard she got straight A's.
He is so bald.
Nice much.
Like you've got a grip.
Right.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
I am.
You can learn to like it.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Big League pitchers don't use these.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Nuke?!
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
I'm trying to play with your body!
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
it's okay..
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
He's a virgin.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Aren't we all?
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
No.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
Yeah...you a witch?
I can do that, too.
What's it say?
Ninety-five miles an hour...
Which one of us?
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Who's he play for?
You missed him!
It was a cocksucking call!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Go for it.
Annie's a smart lady.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Love to--
Pussy.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
It's a damn convention.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
What?
Why are you doing this to me?
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
Was I at that dinner?
I was in the building!
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
All right, take care.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
702 472 1862.
Right back.
Matter of fact...
Eight.
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
Why, somebody's complaining?
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Nope, there's no way.
No, I don't wanna come -
I'll be honest with you.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Yeah.
I lost control?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
It's none of my business?
Why?
I -
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Sammy.
It's me.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
No, Ace.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
No. Just stop everything.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Call security.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Who's this?
Ginger's mission in life was money.
See you, Ginger.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Thank you.
Good luck.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Uh-huh.
What do you need?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
Okay.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
What's it...
...twenty-five thousand?
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Fuck you!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
And where'd you go?
What if he won't stop?
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
You want your jewelry?
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I wouldn't do that...
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I'm not -
Let me in the house! Fucker!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
How many kids do you have?
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
What?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Sam?
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Carmine left?
Stay out of the way!
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Hm.
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
I'll be right out.
Mm.
All right.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Okay, Sammy.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
Oh, come on.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
I don't - 
Yeah?
Come on. Don't be scared.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
It's what you want?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
But I saw something...
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Get lost?
Lester - he called you here.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
I think that's it.
Why?
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Remo.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
They'll do it.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
You are right. What can I...
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
It's okay. Let her go.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
What about "climbing in?"
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
I know.
And...your point?
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
I still have one left...
You've seen me...
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
What?
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
But I'm blind.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Yes, Mother. Dear.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
Where do you think you're going?
This is one way.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Theo wants to talk again.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
It's taken care of.
Not this minute.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
What about the others?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
And that was the end of it?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Sometimes I paint.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
That's not her.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Are you okay?
Your husband?
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Hand me the phone.
There isn't any such person.
I thought it was inspired.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
A typical fuck-up.
You could've hit me.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
Why are we stopping?
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Took preparation.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
Some loyalty.
Talk to the man.
I still don't see you.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Are you trying to panic the women?
The fuck I will!
I thought you'd know me by now.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
How do you know?
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Mind if I have a look?
Let her tell you.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
Nice.
What would you call it?
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
An excellent quality.
I would expect he does.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
You heard me --
Please, Dil --
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's a simple question.
Not in my experience.
Who's she?
Hi. You forgot your bag.
They all get the wrong idea.
He wants me to perform for him.
No, I didn't --
Jesus.
Yes, please.
Didn't think I could.
He did sometimes.
Something I heard someone say once.
Yeah.
What you doing here?
Know what, honey?
So they do know.
Sorry.
Absolutely.
Delirious.
Okay.
Kind of.
You could say that.
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
I promise.
I'm sorry.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
No! I'm going home...
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
Jimmy?
Don't go like that.
Stop it, Dil --
Will I see you again?
The Metro.
You know her, Jimmy?
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Leave me alone, Jude.
And what if you don't?
I take pride in my work.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
Peter.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Good. So what do you think?
Can't.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
Am I?
What is it now?
Do what?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
I didn't even fancy her.
What?
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Absolutely not.
Suppose you could say that.
Don't I know it.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
And you play cricket?.
How different?
My pleasure, Jody
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Shut up, would you?
Yeah?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Doesn't matter where.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
A story.
Yeah?
Why?
Stop that talk now --
Got to catch me first --
Hurling --
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
You're crazy --
Where are you, ol' buddy?
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Well -- come on.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
I love you, Adam.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
With whom? Where?
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
I'm through listening to you!
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
But --
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Barely, yes.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Oh. Then who's this one?
Me? Why me?
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
No.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I said with the mouth shut.
Open it.
The view had better be worth it.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Reggie?
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Would you like to see my passport?
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Reggie -- listen to me --
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Okay.
Cutting it out.
You did.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
No.
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I don't believe it.
It's a start, anyway.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
What do you mean?
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
What's its value today?
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Leave me alone -- !
I'm very confused.
He didn't have one.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
And this? And this?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
What?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Be careful, Peter.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
How do you know what they're doing?
What are you talking about?
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
But what?
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
We will separate -- you look over there.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I never fucked Rod.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Run!
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She's still a virgin.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I can.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?

Daddy....
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
What are you doing here?
You know about that too?
Of course I'm scared.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
You eventually have to talk to him.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
FINE. Are you?
I won't.
Stag?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
No.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Did Sharon say no?
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
That's not why we broke up.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Hi princess.
You can ask me anything.
And the police did nothing?
Just thinking about something.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
Hi Sandy.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
Freezer in the back.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
Peace.
Come on!
...all the time.
 Excuse me...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
Okay, okay! 
You're nuts, goin' back there!
Doesn't...


Okay.
...gun?!
 No...
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
All right, you got it.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Goddamn!
Come on.
...Night Shift, but you might...
...you crazy bastard.
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Holy--!
 ...shit!

Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
...yeah.

Then stay...
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
Oh, no!

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...-tion?
You know what I'm sayin'?
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
We got two paddles.
Yeah, baby!
I think you oughta cut a...
...man.
We're gonna die!

Reach into my pocket.


 That's why I didn't give it...

Forty-five seven!
Okay.
...they come!
...our ass!
 

We got-...
Hold this. 
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.

...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
That's bullshit.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
That was quick.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
Three seconds.  One...
And it won't be pleasant. 
Hey!
So...where's my truck?
I did what I could for you...
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
...help you?
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
Thank you.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...

Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
...to be off the island tonight.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
You have my word on that.
...destroyer of worlds."
You'll kill us all!
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.

Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...

No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
I think I gave it to her.
Who's the investigating officer?
Where from?
That's too bad.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
She's fine.
With her mother.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Where's that?
I don't know...
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
No.
No?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Didn't you call?
What pictures?
And why's that?
Shut up.  Go on.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
A private investigator?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Oh... thank you.
A check?
Where you were when your husband died.
You mean you don't know where you were?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
I gave everybody the night off.
Why?
Doing what?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
...A flaw...
It has to do with my father.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
Including the death of your husband?
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Where's the girl?
What are you saying?
She's my daughter.
She's my sister and my daughter!
Back to Mexico.
With us.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
A Miss Sessions calling.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes?
Never.
It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
...Yes of course.
Yeah.
He was expecting you?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
So I can have these? 
Then why don't you change jobs? 
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
We'll talk about that later.
Who?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Two cents.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Well, well - isn't that nice?
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
September the ninth?
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
We've got a nice plant here.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
No.  But you're close.
I work at Seligman's.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
It's been a tough day.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
I'd like that.
I've got to think of Emily -
Why is she leaving me?
Are you finished?
It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
I know you will.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
What do you mean by that?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
That's the train with all the lights.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Rawlston is my boss.
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
Well, thanks a lot.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
I had a toothache.
What did you get?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
How long have you been a smoker?
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Can I join in?
He went home to change for the big date.
No, this is great.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Awww. That was so cute.
So you're really getting married?
No, you're not really getting married?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Just me.
Nobody. It was closed.
I'll assess all I want!
Lenin's Tomb.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
No, thanks.
Did you tell Veronica?
Eight and a half?
She called you Brad?
Oh yeah.
Blasphemy.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And you figured it out?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
What kind of show?
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
FUCK!
Sorry.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
No, you're not.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
I'm going with you.
Twenty-two; same as us.
How'd he die?
That's embarrassing?
I swear.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Reach what?
Why should I loan you my car?
Let me borrow your car.
Exactly.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Because I'm happy.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
Could be.
Shut the fuck up!
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
Oh, like your life's any better?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
Thanks.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
Yes.
Thirty-fire.
I don't have love handles.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
I don't think so.
How much can you bench?
No, she's getting married.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
I should start.
Nothing personal.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Really?
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Including you; yes.
Three.
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Lower your voice!
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
What time do you get finished?
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
What?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
That's tight. Solid.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Bye. 
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
Hal will have my head for this.
I copy.
Where's the radio?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Nice and easy...
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
I don't think you do.
I don't expect you to understand.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Maybe lead to a flare up...
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
What are you doing here!?
What about you?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Want me to lead?
Breathtaking.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
No, he's gone.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Then it's a deal.
Let's move your ass in there!!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Richard Travers.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Help me, sir?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Alex.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
You wanna be sick?
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
We're going to friends now, sir.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
You mean like going to the pictures?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Yes!!!
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
Amen. They cross themselves.
Prison custody?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Are you feeling better?
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
What?
You got a deal.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
You psychic?
How often you go?
Max...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
You're kidding me.
'Fraid so.
I'm sorry.
I think...
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Wouldn't dream of it.
So?
What thing?
Oh?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
I've been calling and calling.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Two, two-fifty.
I don't think I can do this.
I think so.
Yes.
Play music.
What?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Why?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
No, not just that.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Who?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Just drop me off.
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Them who?
As opposed to?
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
This would be it?
Pretty scary, huh?
Is this your dad?
Not this again.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
Okay, I will.
What?
Now's not really the time to get into this --
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Where are you?
You think it's a conspiracy?
That's great.  Good for you.
Well, I don't know if --
I'm leaning toward no.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
You've asked me that one three times.
Excuse me?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
The truth shall make you free.
Terminal?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Working.
Not today...
This doesn't make sense.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
No.  Not yet.
And Jonas?
Where do you think Jerry is?
What do you suggest?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Ellie?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
No, thanks.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
With me.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
What would you have me say, David?
How soon will you be able to decode it?
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
Put it on speakers.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Because I can't.
But what do I say?
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Can you help us?
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
Peter Valerian.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
You too.
It's really happening.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
If you came back.
Really.
I don't follow.
It's late.  We should go back.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
In other words.
Meaning...
I'll make it a dollar.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Here, Mom.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Yeah.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Ram it in and break it off!
He's probably a gigolo.
Git to work!
Yes, Boss.
She's got him! You hear that?
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Tramp! Beautiful!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
We got it locked in the sock.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Call.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Only kidding!
What did I do?
Fear of what...
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
But </u>alive</u>!
Hal has it.
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
You know I can't do that.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
Is he out?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
That's no surprise.
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Not yet.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
I'll get a locksmith.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Oh, I know.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
What about her arms?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Good.
That's always your privilege, sir.
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
And her husband? What was he?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It is?
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
I'd like to go back. James...
James.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Hard to say.
Yes.
You could get your wish at any moment.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
I did this already.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Yeah, and a dimple.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Do you think I should?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Ecru.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Tomorrow?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Mom, please.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
There's a spider in my room.
Terrific.
No.
That must be really difficult.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Tell the doctor.
Your family just met me.
Michael, I...
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Do you like it?
No.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
You, too. Kick ass today.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
And all the plans we have.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I mean tonight.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
Sure. Of course.
I'm calling in sick.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Yes.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh.
I start on Monday.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
I'll float you.
Do you know who this is?
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
What?   This?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
It's Elvis...
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Oui.
You don't trust me?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I'm just setting my boundaries.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
What about the money?
You didn't buy batteries?
I can't believe you didn't check.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
What for?
We'll think of something.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
You better.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
We had a deal.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
The Holiday Hotel.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I see.   A master criminal.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Relax. It will be fine.
Me?
Mr. Taylor?
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
God, I want to go home.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
They sort of got away.
Yeah.   It's mine.
How?
Yeah, I dig him.
Cool.
Wait here.
Where is it, Sophie?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
I don't know.
Tonight.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
Something like that.
Something like that.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
No.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
A car.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
Let's go!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Really?
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Only the sword will settle this.
Then you have no use for the sword.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Give it back.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It's time for me to leave it behind.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
Have you questioned him yet?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
But Wudan does not accept women.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
What about you?
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
I'm buying.
No onions?
Annie, I need a file.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
I knew that.
You don't say.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
In a better place.  I hope.
I don't know you.
Murderer.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
That's ancient history.
Another jolly nickname?
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Shelly?
Leave me alone -- !
Go away.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
Fine with me.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Is he inside?
No shooting.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Annette Harrison.
That's right.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Why are you being so dramatic?
That's a matter of opinion.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Why not?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Okay.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
Yes it does.
No.
That's not fair.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Yeah, me neither.
What are you saying?
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Any ideas who it could be?
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
Okay.
I... I don't think you want to know.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
Just taking your photo.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
I swear.
I do.
It works a little.
Yummy.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
I'll be in touch.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Likewise I'm sure.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
Racist piece of shit.
Outstanding.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Care to make a wager on that?
Could you be more desperate to read it?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Okay.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Cecile.
So what went wrong?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Where is she?
Where'd she go?
And that's why you're leaving?
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Well done.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
I think you have your answer.
I'll do that.
Do you know when she'll be back?
I did?
Excuse me?
Don't worry about it.
What are you talking about?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
How?
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
Oh, lots of times.
Do you know the people?
But it's already come true.
What's her name?
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
It's early yet.
I live right here.
Yes, I did.
I'll show you.
Yes, daddy.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
It was just a voice.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
But there's no one here, darling.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Your children?
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Yes, Amy.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
No, thank you.
Why hasn't he got a head?
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
Yes...yes, that's true.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
And Amy mailed them?
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
I've changed a lot lately.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
Nearly four.
What does that have to do with me?
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
No. I don't think so.
And my bra finally fits again.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
You should have seen it erect.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Check out what I found.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
No. I won't let you do that.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Frida? You okay?
Knock what off?
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
Oh my god, by wolves?
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Briefs.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
A man killed in Central Park.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
They do? Oh no...
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Worse than this?
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Thanks.
Packages of money.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
Take some allergy medicine.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
The other one?
How will we interrogate them?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Loose ends?
Iím sorry...
Why, yes.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
Who?
No...  No doctor...
No.  Have a look.
Wait, this isn't fair...
Then we must call the police.
You know something about me?
Not that again...
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
I'm...  being...  punished.
You're kidding?
Don't worry about it.
A month.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
TilT we figure something out.
Like how?
Up and around?  Soon?
Exactly. A condition.
What about containment, Alan?
Fine.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Clean.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
I'm going to kill him.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Just what you think I mean.
I'm not sure.
You could buy it on payments.
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Oh my gosh...
I'm afraid so.
I don't think so.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
We vetoed that?
Wrong...
He's not.
Does it make the cars any better?
Certainly.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
What do you mean?
Really?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
What?
I can't say.
Yeah.
No.
Certainly.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
I had a feeling.
The Vice-President...
Well...
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Mind if I sit down?
Anybody would have done it.
It's just so strange...
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
Just wait.
You have a lot of secrets.
You find people jobs?
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Hi.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
The tunnel.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
The hospital? 
Maybe.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Knox?
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
Women swoon!
What is the point?
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
I think you're sweet.
What?
Doing fine, sir.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
That's not my fault.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
It does?  What?
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Sort of.
You are?  She's glad I called!
But, Chris...
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
I didn't know you taught.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Don't stop!
I have something.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Good luck.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
But different.
That's miles.
I... I just don't want to come.
Yes.  But
Found what?
What is that supposed to mean?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
I will be with thee straight.
Yea, art thou there?
Do you have to quit the play?
Yes.
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
And where is our point of arrival?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Dead.
Just trying to get to my boat...
That's what I do.
On the side!!
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The quiet...
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
I'm stuck...
One whistle... Start the engine...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Joey...
Where is everybody?
Poolside?
You want some too?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Maybe plans changed...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
We're all going.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
I know, but...
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Married?
You mean...?
You are frightened, no?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Where is he???
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Oh. Fine.
You know a guy named Merle?
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
No?
Nick, she won't say why.
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Here.
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Right here.
Right.
Pow.
What else?
I'm doing that too.
What do you think?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
We what?
More bullets in the gun?
Sit down.
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Then lemme have 'em.
That's my plan.
See you Monday.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Listen, Nick --
No.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Kimberly!
Fuck you - fuck you.
When you bring in Doucet.
You're crazy.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
What the hell are you talking about?
Shut up!  Drop it.
I got it.  I got it.
Not the 'T' word.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
How do you know?
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Drop it.
I'll be okay.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
What else did he get?
Simulated one.
How ya feeling?
...What are you talking about...?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
And you should be with your family.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
No -- that's for me to do.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
No, thank you -- what's your name?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
That's just too bad --
Howdy, Hank.
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
But what becomes of our souls?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Opportunities?
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Leave your tongue off of that!
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Yes -- at midnight.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Morning, Jabez.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Camomile tea!
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Why not -- ?
Oh, Jabez.
Who is it?
We can still use my butter money.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
I am going to lock him up.
It shows on your face.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Wouldn't profit him none.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Mary -- Jabez --
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
I won't forget.
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
The past six months.
What does he want?
And if he alters it...?						*
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Who are you, then?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Go fuck yourself.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
Then don't waste time talking to me.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Oh...Where does he live?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Thanks...partner.
I'm here, cowboy.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I still feel like shit.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
What about the kids?
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Yeah... I know.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
You don't have a choice?
Are they on the phone still?
Right.  See you sometime.
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
I'm not alone.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
He's all doped up.
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Come on, lemme load you up...
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
I don't know.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
Special to me, too.
Sure - we like you.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
I'm glad it's okay.
Yeah.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
What?
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
Yeah ...
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Okay, Sonny.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
I speak what I feel.
Sonny - Here's your document.
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Oh.  Run.
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
What about your toe?
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
<i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.
Yes.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Stop it.
I said stop it.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
Hello?
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
There are no bond certificates.
No. What's the big deal?
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Do you know where Danang is?
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
Real good.
Nobody.
<i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i>
<i>The tough get going.</i>
Real fast.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Jade, I still love you.
You a troublemaker?
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
You the man.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
Is it a good morning?
Gotta go.
OK.  OK.
Wake up!
I'm in here.
He's completely innocent.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Sorry, comb got caught.
Look at that.
What is?
Him no white.  Him no white.
I got no say over people.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Can't do.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Quit bullshitting.
Gotta go.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Come in then.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Trust me.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
What?
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Too many pizzerias already there.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, I think.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
In the new library there.
Four colors? Neato!
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Yeah...
Yeah, but I'm buying.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
I don't follow.
I know I am, Mom.
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Probably because we've never met.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
Why not?
No.
The second R is silent.
You brave soldier.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Sounds like a pirate.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Shut up!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
Don't look directly at him.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Yea!
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
You can't marry my mom.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
A blimp.
Who?
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
I know I did.
I lugged it all over town!
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Roger that, Wilco.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
You were born free and free you should remain.
Can you believe it?
Uh-oh. Harry?
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
But we don't drink from the house do we.
And I you.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
And...?
Wow, you are smart.
Everything. Just for the record.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
Love it!
Piter.
With your permission...
Yes?... How was your journey?
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
Is this what you seek?
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
Where are we do you think?
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
What can be done has been done.
Those sounds could be imitated.
No.
I predict we're lost.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Huh?
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Ah, so I pull the strings!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Dracula?
Ah!  This is very exciting.
I didn't feel well...
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
But maybe not.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
You mean a Tesla coil?
Rolling.
This is kind of a stream--
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
I thought he was dead.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
But you used to say --
I understand you just moved here?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
But Greta say --
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Are you a fruit?
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
Who?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
What do you mean?
STOP!
Bela died.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The poor girl's out of a job.
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Yes!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Who?
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Isn't that the same thing?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Come on...
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Yes!
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
This is real, Bananahead!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
What if Shari's the dream?
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Good luck.
Mm...  Oh, man...
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
When? Today?
Oh.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Oh God. What hospital?
Why? How...
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
What are you talking about?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Who's in it?
I hear the dog really liked him.
Dynamite.
It's... okay
Can't we just --
Yeah, well...
Why?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
I really like you too...
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
...yeah?
No. It's your fault.
Everybody's someone.
What are you drunk?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
What?
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Yeah?!
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
No. What happened?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
You watching the ballgame?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the cameras here!
Yeah.
I know.
Save it.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
No problema.  You want a picture?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Hi.
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Ed... I'm sorry.
What...
Hi.
We have to stop meeting like this.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
That's the point -- this could change things.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
pierdo.
pierde.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Here, get down.
Anything wrong?
Dick.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
Yeah?
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
As far as I know, they--
That sounds good.
Doing what?
Take as much room as you want
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
Sure.
Dave.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
So?
For what?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Paul, get out!
What'd I do?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
Are you sorry she's dead?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
It's Bud.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
That simple, huh?
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Look at a picture for me.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
Yeah.  A great big one.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
More.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Gone.  Not a trace.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
What's this all about, lad?
What?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Officer White?
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Something good?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Nothing.
I don't know what that means.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Why?
Really?
Who was that other guy?
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
No shit.
Look, my wife is understandably--
How do you know so much?
They come after you?
Why?
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Tell me about it.
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
Listen--
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
No.
How fast can you learn?
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Not particularly, no.
Well then who can?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
With what?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
I'm married.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
The robbery.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
About what?
Somebody took my blender.
No, sir.
No.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Not a very good one, but--
Something bad happened tonight.
What do you mean?
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Just reporters.
What happened to your head?
Well...yeah.
That's okay.
You opened the thing?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
It's a brand new card.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I don't believe it is, no.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
It tastes like fish.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Brill.
Yes.
You're not.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
Why?
You got a minute?
For the last four years.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
You have to.
I'm sorry about that.
We believe he did.
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Can I open 'em up?
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Bobby--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
To the cops?
No. No, it's okay.
Yeah?
He got hit by a bus.
I honestly don't know.
You would?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
We found the originals.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Dean's with Lyle.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
No.
Yes sir.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Excuse me.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
No, but I think I do.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
No.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
What?
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
What?
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
In my room.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
No.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
I don't know what that means.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Are you planning to be the exception?
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Is there a song you don't know?
Very true!
What?
Apprentices.
To arm-twisting.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Yes?
Your friend?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
You get Hardy.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
Nya-nya-nya!
Then come with me.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Go away.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
How awful.  What will you do?
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
He's on to something bigger.
Who am I?
Uh, yes.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
I sincerely hope so.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
It's not for sale.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
You can't.
Give him the card.
We're only going one way.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Good morning.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
We go underwater?
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
It's---beautiful.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
You're not on the beat.
Shut up.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Okay, 80-20--
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Where the money is.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
I sincerely hope not.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
But--
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
You gave them the eight billion.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
It's those files you asked for.
Which one?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
You're a lawyer?
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Yup.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
Don't bother.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
Erin --
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
You're not gonna be there.
Erin --
Yesterday.
And ...?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
It happens all the time.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
I'm gonna go live with George.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
You got a little girl?
Why not?
Thanks for reminding me.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna clean it up.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
How would you know?
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
That is not what I'm --
What's that?
Mm-hm.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
That's okay.  I understand.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
Have you been logging on?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Yeah.  Who are you?
Uh-huh?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Next week.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
You did?
The Emperor?
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
The boy is our last hope.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
I feel The Force.
Everyone's invited, of course.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
Sit down, and shut up!
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
We are fighting for a cause much ...
What is it?
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
How do I look?
Yes, you do.
That's quite a compliment.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Where?
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
A mining colony.
Can you trust him?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Hyperdrive.
I'm sorry too.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
Thanks.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Luke!
That sounds familiar.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
Let's go.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
You are reckless!
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
But I feel The Force flowing!
If it must be.  Yes.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
I'll die first.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
I want that ship.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Believe what?
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Not anymore.
Don't lie to me.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Having second thoughts?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
I'm here.
So where's Plissken?
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Delgado?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
We'll see.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Who?
Are you crazy?
Sewers. Come on.
Give me the prototype.
Yeah.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
I cannot--
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
That's not why you came.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Your mother told you that?
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I'm going.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Just show the sword.
One land, one king! That is my peace!
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Well what's wrong?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
Hi, how'd your day go?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What didn't he tell you?
Burke.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
What is it?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
What's her name?
You're a nice man.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
Fine thank you.
You're kidding! Like what?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Convulsion?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Yes am.
No I didn't know you had one.
He didn't mention her.
The priest.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Are you sure?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
When can I have one?
You like it?
The closet
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
Here I'll show you.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
What?
I don't know, I just thought.
Okay.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
I'm not Regan.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
It would bring us together.
You and us.
Uh Huh.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Uoy era ohw.
Oh really, when?
Why?
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Only what I read in the papers.
Yeah, a fall.
Sick priest, is that it?
I've seen it.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Be silent!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Just a minute.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
It's our goddamn car!
Little slow tonight.
It's all there.  Both nights.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
You bring trunks, Jack?
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
How will he eat?
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
Get your hand off me.
Out.
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
My pleasure.
Am I late?
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Fuck him.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Why the interest?
I don't gotta go.
Says who?
You'll see.
What do you mean?
We don't get a gig.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
What?
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Talk.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
It never was.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Come on, stand still.
Here, how's this?
So what do you think?
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Okay.
No, you take the right.
Good idea.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
What the hell are these?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
February?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You could've come.
No.
I don't know. Some disease.
Seventy-one
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
All right.
I'm sorry?
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
You're an hour and a half late.
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
Big feet.
Right.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Tell her.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Job.
Downstairs.
Pretty much.
I suppose.
His kid's sick.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Better than that.
Who's Nina?
He called her.
So, what happened?
Coffee?
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
I've given it up.
I didn't want to wake you.
Another five years, huh?
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Looks old.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
Let me have a look.
Only one you've never broken.
We need to talk.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Not anymore.
I'm going to have you fired.
Like you know anything about it.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
You mean like ... condoms?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
No problem.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
What about me?
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
On a case by case basis...
Kate’s my wife...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
I’ve got all the time in the world...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
Get out, I call 911.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Okay, chief.
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
All in one tape?
About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that...
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
What?
You hear me complaining about that?
...my feet are hurtin’...
And...?
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
That’s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
But I’m gettin’ close, right?
Okay...
Are you sure?
Worse, you mean...
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
Don’t worry about it, Jack...
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
I'd like that, too.
So we'll get egg nog.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Got it, teach.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Ben, are you there?
Oh, it is.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
So are you!
Not this again --
Okay, "mom."
Dude.  That's my sister.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Not at all.
It's been changed.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Yes, thanks.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
That's what we're here to find out.
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
I gave him twenty.
Why didn't you say something?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Phase Two.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
The less time, the better.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
The Other Side got to him.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
We must!
They're much smaller than bacteria...
Now I know...
But I did. I'm positive!
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
That's what they pay me for.
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
Nothing -- against all that force.
Yes...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Oxygenation...
No, there's no other way.
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
What about Dr. Michaels?
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
Send the following message...
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
That line was tampered with...
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Go ahead.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
No Jean, no money!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
I don't think so. It's nice.
...What're you talking about?
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
No.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Personal matters.
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Oh, yah, I know that!
You have children?
Mr. Mohra?
I unnerstand.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Oh, yah?
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Brainerd?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Know who this is?
Yah.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
2:30.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Mm.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Nope.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah?
Oh, yah?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
No, no, that's fine.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
The day of our homicides.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Yah?
No, no.
Yah.
Well -
Right, right.
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
We're still men.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Yeah, both of us.
Yes?
Can't you give me something?
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
Marla?
Really?
Like testicular cancer?
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
It suits you.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Here.
Nothing.
Whatever.
Hear what?
... A person.
What is wrong with you?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
What?
Who do you think I am?
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Pardon me?
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
This is how we fill up our lives.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Call what off?
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Doesn't matter.
Good answer.
Yeah, I'm sure.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
Yes, I promise.
I said I promise!
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Tell him!
... is over.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
I don't know!  Tell me!
What... ?
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
What have you left for me?
What?
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
You told me you'd say that.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
No!
It's free to all.
How'd you know?
Please, God, no...
Why?
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
You were there?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
I have to save Eugene!
Should we knock?
Taken care of.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Maybe.  What's this about?
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I know how it feels to be dead.
No, I'm good.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
I guess so.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
I know, we'll be there soon.
I'm... really sorry.
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
As in flannels and plaids?
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Get out! Get out of the car!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
You're the fuckin' devil.
That's a plan.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
No.
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Star Wars?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Start over.
Show me how it operates.
Read you.
Where's your stuff?
Exactly.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Yeah...
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
I need a vacation.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
You comin'?
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Huntington Beach, California.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
I couldn't get you in.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
What's the plan?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
We just take pictures?
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
American.  Come to get you out.
Colonel.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Got any more bread crust?
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
I was attacked.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
Fine.  I'll say no.
Fine.
No, I have to work.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
How much?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Sshhhh!
The Little People?
God... I'm the janitor of God.
But I can't get it... He's...
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Bingo!
What?
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
It sounds exciting.
I leave it to you.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Serveza yourself!
No, dammit, I would easy.
I'm not some piece a crap.
You'll be gone, period.
What the hell is that?
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
It brings out my eyes...
Okay...
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Well, you seem very professional...
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
Don't, then.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
There's nothing to say, Tita...
I don't know.
My turn.
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
That's dangerous, you know.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
The day after tomorrow.
Thank you.
I didn't have any.
None.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Shut up...
That's what you said?
I'm fine.
Of course I'd like to.
I'll be back later...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Yes.
What?
Is she?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
That's what I mean...
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
No, it's okay.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Yes.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Nothin'.
I, umm, came to see you.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I buy them flowers.
I did.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Positive.
Yeah.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
My God, you're serious.
Can I ask anybody now?
What'll it be Fletch?
Not a prayer.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Just relax....
Just relax.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Okay. Some idea.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I'm serious, Sam.
Nothing. They're still there.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Thank you.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
You may be right.
Whoops.
Oh, about ten days ago.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
Right.
They bust you every week.
What?
What's that?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
In this drawer....
Sure, all drifters do.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Cute thing.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
John Ultrarelamensky.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
I love the outfits.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Hi.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
It's amazing.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
How do you know about that?
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
I think you better sit down.
Bastard.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Lock's busted.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Irwin...
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
...never reads the paper...
You broke it? You know the source?
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
What...
Jim Swarthout?
My secretary.
Of course.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you...
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Ye-ah.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
You need it.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
I'm off it!
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Are you okay?
Fuck me...
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
Julian, you're fired.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Doyle.
What?
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Non!
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Mmm.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Marseilles.
Yeah, I know.
Strike out, eh?
How'd I know he had a knife.
He coulda been white.
Policy man in Queens.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Yeah.
Let yourself in.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Third time around.
Darling, may I have this one?
I been damn careful up to now.
Nothing.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Don't know what's behind it.
Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
He ain't the only one.
Okay...
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I know.  He loves that thing.
The future guy?
Hello, Frank.
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
How's that?
Frank, please...
Frank, this is insane...
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What's happening?
1998.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
I think I'm losing you.
I lost you.
I never knew you, Dad.
She's not here.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
You there?
H-hi.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Dad, you there?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Uh, huh.
Yeah.  Sure.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
You work too hard, John.
Yeah, that's right.
I try to be.
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Where's Shelly?
If you insist.
I vote for me.
Barely.
Chuck... look.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Is that so bad?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
May be please have the wallet.
Maybe.
Damn you, Shelly!
I just want you to like me.
Alright, alright.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Sheriff, you better take this.
I could swear I heard...
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Uh...yes.  But...
'Cause it stinks.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
Nancy.
I found it outside.
We'll scare 'em right back.
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Boy scouting.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Do you have to ask?
N...nothing.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
For a good reason.
Sorry.
Her name's Stephanie.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Next, you dial a number.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
I'm now begging you.
Have a good night.
Yeah...
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
I mean really never.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
What are you going to do?
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Nothing.
No.
Rennie's not coming.
I packed it. Just for us.
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm staying.
She didn't push me into coming.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
But Sean said...
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Just felt a little chill.
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Yeah...a lot.
Just radio for help, okay???
Please, hurry...
That's where I peed.
I don't want to hear about it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Do not inhale.
Here we go.
No, we're not.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
What are you talking about?
Let's work on it.
About what?
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
The Red Sox
We don't even like each other, do we?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
I have a class. I'm late.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Yes.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Who the hell cares?
She's my gynecologist.
Life is good.
It's me. Nicky.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Get yourself something to eat.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Since when did that matter?
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
Oh yeah?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's a simple subject.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
Because God loves a winner.
This could be it!
Why do you care?
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
I have excellent long-term memory.
What color?
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Engaging.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
As I told you about English policemen.
Everyone takes his turn.
All the more reason.
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I thought you were a man of God.
Did they take your clothes?
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
He said he's in charge...
"Hell!"
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
You will respect the law.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
There is nothing I can give.
That was England.
It's split the Government.
Somehow I expected not.
I congratulate them.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
He's "discovering" India.
Have you found him?
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Er, no...
I like football.
It would be five thousand more.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Blood.  From the vein.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Thank you, no.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Michael's.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
In case you get back before I do.
Antonio, the choir...
I hope he's not just a body.
Why not?
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
I've found him too.
They found an eyelash.
What exactly is wrong?
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
We could go together one day.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Stay clean.
And you got him...
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Small town, small bank, big money.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
No. It's been a long time.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
That bad?
At least you were outside.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Sure...
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Whatever happens it's over.
I don't see how.
You and me.
Who was it?
Pull over.
We walk.
No, I'm afraid not.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Okay. How many bank exits?
What about the vault?
I'm good at that.
Aren't we going a little hard?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
He took the day off.
Can't leave the desk.
Just fine.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
How?
Nothing. What could I do?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What happened to this car?
This is my brother's car.
Yeah.
Why?
Jack, you're wrong.
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Once a week?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
Oh, do you?
No.
Was he?
Brumby.
Now you're asking.
Yeah.
Nice of you to come.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. It's all right.
They said he was drunk.
I left last year.
At me friend's house.
That's what I was wondering.
Large Scotch.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Oh yes? How?
It never is.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
My brother, Frank.
No. Really, I am.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Still got a sense of humour?
Piss off, Ray.
Yes.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
...Polacks...
I'm not?
To get on the...
What?
You get a bad month, all of a...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
No.
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
He is?
What hard part?
That's right...
What?
What do you mean?
Yes...?
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
Talking about it as a...
No.  Not actually.
For five thousand?
He would take you on.  Yes.
I'm sorry?
I...
Yes.
Yes.
Why would I do it?
...and rob the place...
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
What?  You can't do any what?
Huh?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Where was I?
Where did Moss...?  I...
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Excuse me...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
...did they...
Levene!!
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
Not lately it isn't.
Murray...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
You know what those leads cost?
Murray said...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Now.  Yes...When?
Because I say so.
It's not impossible.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
I don't know what you are saying.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Uh-huh?
Mmm.
I'm sorry.
Fuck you.
Guess who?
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
From the store.
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
He's right, Williamson.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Sure.
Which...
Go ahead.
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Mm.
Did I...?
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
I don't know.
The check wasn't cashed?
She told me I have to.
I...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Fuck the Machine.
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Yes.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I'm not hungry.
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
She couldn't decide.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
I saw him with you.
Because I need MONEY!
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
No, Dad.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Let's go.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
 And he agreed?
I'm going to see my parents.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
She's gone, Tom.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you're wrong...
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Mike wants it.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Goodbye, Michael.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
The baby I lost...
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
No, I'm fine.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Let him gamble.
I deny his every charge.
I do not.
When do we talk?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
What was that?
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Weird.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Tea is fine.
Your wife?
Why?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Of course.  I am married still.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
Well...no, not really --
Mornin'.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
What?  Oh yes.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
What's to sketch?
Broke is more like it.
Football in college.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
No.  I could have, though.
I'm not, you know.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
But we have to match the other sketch.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
Not at the moment.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
What happened?
Do you miss it?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Something happened to him?
No harm done.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
No.  Definitely not.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
The Great War?
A very lucky thing indeed.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Pray you, undo this button.
All right.
Fuck off!
I just want to watch it, okay?
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
More your line.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Of course.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Luminal.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
I don't mind.
Quite.
Of course.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Sit?
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Point-five ...
How ya doing?
Yes ... Kip ...
I don't want him hurt...
I knew you'd say that.
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
You got no choice. It's over.
How is he?
How's Atley -- ?
A little family emergency --
Double-meaning intended --
Not at all ...
Good.
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
How you doing, man?
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
How's Kip?
No.
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Mother -- !
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Yes, sir -
Hello, Memphis --
Yeah ...
Yeah -
Okay --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
I can handle it --
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
The era when crime didn't pay --
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
I know. I've missed you, too
I know ...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
Thought I'd go for a ride -
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Now, we go -
Call 'em here -- ?
What are you doing here?
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
What's wrong with her -- ?
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
That what you want?
I always thought you'd follow me up.
Oh, yeah.
Deodorant.
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I take out my slim-jim...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Yeah ... You -- ?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Hello, Otto ...
No we don't -
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
She left...
Who's "Eleanor?"
So she flies -
So what's in there -- ?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
No more shines, Billy.
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Nods again.
I understand.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
I'm in construction.
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
Shit.
Jezuz Christ!
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Yeah.
I can't make any more deliveries.
You're some fucking jerk.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Tommy  ...
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
I don't want them left back.
Yeah.
Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--
What are we gonna do up there?
Fuck you.
No, and we got four of 'em.
No one. I didn't have the number.
Gone.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
You don't know that.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
How you doin'?
You caught that, huh?
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
You could put a pool in that backyard.
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
No students work for me.
That's right.
I don't know what it's called.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I appreciate that.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
I'll be okay.
Tom.
I been here a couple years.
I think so.
Who?
--Gerry--
--I'm not angry at you--
--I don't have any anger at you--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
He was my roommate in college.
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
I don't got a crush on her.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Have you read all these books, Will?
How about the ones on that shelf?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
285.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Hence, the word remarried.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
What did I think?
Define that.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
It sure ain't good.
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
Good luck.
What?
Okay, sounds good.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Yes you were.
Not far from here, South Boston.
You know, nothing special.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
No.
Exactly.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
No.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Yeah, but how do you know?
And you're sure about that?
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What am I scared of?
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Don't hold me so tight.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Sure, but what is this?
Four.
Why, I guess so.
Which way is House 25?
Say, who runs this place?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
I never heard nothin' about it.
What you figger to do?
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
I ain't gonna run.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
I aim to.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Lissen, I heard that before--
Want to work, do you?
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Naw--not much!
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
Take her with you!
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
No'm.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
I'm ready.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Won't they come out here?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
California, here we come!
We gonna take whatever they got.
I wisht it was day.
Whatsa matter?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
What?
Computer guy.
What?
Really...? So what?
What do you want to do?
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
What's that?
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Unbelievable.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
As long as I get the laugh.
Like love?
No.
Get the fuck outta here.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Come on.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Okay.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
No harm no foul.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Nope.
It was the PLO.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Yup.
One cannot love and kill.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
That's going to cost.
He didn't.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Never enough.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Yeah...
He sold me this bad boy.
That's too bad.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
It is cocktail hour yet?
You sleeping all right in that house?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
How did you find out all that?
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
Tom.
What?!
I won't ask you to.
Annie!
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
The point was to love each other.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
What?
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
You're right. Good.
I'll take care of it.
Did you go riding?
About what?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Tom?
Yeah, you know everything!!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
What?... Oh baby...
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Go ahead...
Who's there?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
No, let me go.
I love you.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
Okay.
I know. We miss you too.
About what?
May I have a suggestion?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
What do you mean?
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
We should be fine, then.
She's an editor.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I don't have all day.
I know where he goes.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
I understand...
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Now that's cool.
Yeah, cool.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Super hero like even.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Difficulty rating?
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
I'm taking over a TV network.
Mm-hmm.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Hmmm.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
What's going on?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
I said give me time.
What?
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I'll make it up to you!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Homicidal?
I think we've got something.
What's happening?
Cancer?
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Virus?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
So?
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Thank you.
Real charmer.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Not without Jamie.
No. You son of a bitch!
Get up there Rachel!
Go!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
How do you know their not?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I'm not calling the fire department.
I can see this is useless.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
How many bodies did you find?
No way. No how.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Double scoops?
It was the nightmare man
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Yeah, hurry up.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Then we'll be safe?
Don't you mean what you do best?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I don't know.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
They didn't know what they were fighting.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
What's going on?
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
The guys think I'm too smart.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Annie!
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can't.
Here, Lester.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Just answer the damn phone.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Could have...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I found the car! He's here!
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Totally.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Hi, Tommy.
Sure.
After the movie.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Will you get her for me?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
I'm wasting time.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
What did you use before?
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Well, let's do it.
Look at this.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Yeah.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Well, are...are they big?
Oh, great.
What are you doing here?
Everything's okay? 
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
I can't say anything!
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Oh, honey!
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Because I have to!
I'm sorry.
You know... 
Like what?!  What?
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I got two minutes.
Huh?
I think so.
Yeah.
Wow!
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
...from Mavis, also.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
True.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Yeah.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
I should get a garter belt.
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Singing?
Really?
Uh-huh.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
We didn't hit it off.
How are you?
...in a really horrible way.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Hmm.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
Yeah.
Okay.
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
I hereby acknowledge that...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Rich, comic book freaks.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
...the whole world's out to get you...
M'I gonna see you tonight?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
...would you excuse me...?
They got that kind of money?
Not with any certainty we...
Seen what, sir..?
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Exactly.
...young boys, still...?
I can make you rich.
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
Let the girl go.
...what's he got against you?
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Said what?
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
How's your <u>child</u>?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
...should love to correct your error. 
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
I'll have them picked up.
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
No. 
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
...but will that satisfy you?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
...and that is what you need to expand.
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
And why should we believe you?
Or clear your windshield with it.
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
Brazilian. 
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...yes, yes, yes....
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
That's right.
Yes.
What is your point?
Yes.
When?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
You have no idea. Now run away.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
You guys have been so colossal...
Goodnight.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
I just never thought of you in that...
How do you mean?                                            ]
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Do you really think I care?
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Shoot.
It's not my style, okay?
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
You're beautiful.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
You goddamn bitch!
Color me nauseous.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Give it up girl!
Suicide is a private thing.
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Sure.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I don't know. Should you?
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Like a suicide thing?
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
I was just making it more special.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Goddamn Geek!
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
But my name's not...
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
frowns at Henry.
I'm not hungry.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
is very angry.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Him . . .
That . . .
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
I'm stumped.
Second most common?
You just made that up.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Well?
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Ambrose. I know.
Where's Allison?
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
How many zeros was your wife worth?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Really, why's that?
Where is she? Where is my wife?
What?
Thanks.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
Who the hell are you talking to?
Ambulance.
Two.
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You mean John Bubber?
Spanish kinda guys!
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
Me!
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Lie, you mean...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
JOEY!
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
That's not what I mean...
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
She can't quit.
What?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Okay.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
-- institution.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I understand that.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Sure.
Just show me the way.
Bye, Neil!
A man scared me.
Uh huh.
Did Daddy tease you?
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
What's that?
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Oh -- great.
No.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Fuck you, Philip.
Did you lock the garage door?
Oh baby.
There might be some extras in the garage.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
What for, dickweed?
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
No.
I didn't.
Get on the other side of that.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
So?
I already told you.  I took a walk.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Most people are afraid of death.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
What?
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Leaving what?
Then it's worth the journey.
I'm sure they will.
She's the King's cousin.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No.  What am I to do?
It's done.
Can you really tell from doing that?
I would like to say goodbye.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
You'll no see me again.
Aye.
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
A lucky guess.
I'll be fine.
New York is dangerous place.
Why?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
No.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
And the other one -- he is like you?
It will end tonight.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
I don't think it is a duplication.
I was working on the cataloging.
We'll see.
I don't know.
Get to work.
It was stolen.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
The best.
I'll make the call.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
He knows better than that.
It's happening right now.
I'm going to my desk.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Like what?
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
What?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
My father.
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
They'll cut the power.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
I overheard him with the girl.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Okey-doke.
You fucked up, Glen.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
I think you got no choice.
You'd better be kidding.
Be quiet!  Listen!
How about dog shit?
Stop it.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
He said something about a girl --
Another minute.  Please --
Go, Chief.
Go.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Order your men to stand down.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Yes, sir.
Special Agent Jones.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
In my room.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
You can let go.
These disks . . . where are they?
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
Your phony FBI assholes.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Where is your family?
There is nothing to it.
Name a price.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
What's happening?
Where is she?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
What did you overhear?
Satellites?
And what will they do with these satellites?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
You said you had no whiskey.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
No, sir.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I am on a list! What list?
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
At least.
Give me the phone.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
I saw the sign.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
He will be here.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
How do you know?
The third floor are low class rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Homework?
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What for Paul.
In Ruhengeri?
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
What's wrong?
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
Oh dear.
More to the point. Where's our host?
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Is she alright?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
And I think that's case --
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Over here!
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
Take the gun.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
I'm better than that.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Let's try down here...
-- was that??
I don't do groups.
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You're hurting me.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Asking the wrong person again.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
You didn't think to ask?
No, no, it's just --
What?
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
I never saw you --
-- confirming everything we already know --
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
-- ten.
It might have been her mother.
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
Suppose not.
A few years older, perhaps.
That poor little girl.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Ok...
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Daddy help!
The place is pretty dusty.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Aubrey!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
What are you talking about?
I'm all right...
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Did you know her very well?
Why?
Thank you.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
It will not take long...
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Oh.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
I don't know ...
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Where?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I'm trying to quit.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Can we see?
You're JP Monroe, right?
A prize?  For what?
Wow.  Thank you.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
It has already begun.
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Gum.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
But I said I was sorry....
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
You're supposed to be dead!
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Oh, I'm so sorry...
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Oh.  Well, what's this?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
This is too bad to be false.
Trust Leonardo....
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
You want an address on that last one?
But you're going to tell us anyway...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
You certainly do.
Alchemy.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Why George, you big softie...
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
With a little jazz.
It's hardly the same --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
He didn't offer you money.
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Why yes, do you know it?
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
-- or lack thereof?
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Every year?
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Worked in a watch factory?
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
I don't know...
Watch it, Archer --
Terrific.
Forty-eight years...
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Yes sir...
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
No, sir.
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
She looks in her purse...
Maybe he's wise.
...Her mother needs an operation...
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
She is!
That's nonsense, Alma.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Alive?
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Yes.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Is she a doctor?
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
It'll wait.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I'm sorry...
Why did you come in here?
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Yes.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
You want to go?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
Stuffed and baking.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Good night kiddo.
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
With Mikey?
Nobody.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It's really quite all right.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
But not too ashamed.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
Out.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Wendy!
Huh?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Can I come?
What time is it?
The ones you built?
Vodka?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Yeah.  All over.
Twelve years younger.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Then change it.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
Has her books in it.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
To do nothing.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
You don't know.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
Who?
Who?
Did you have sex with her?
He.  Well, he...
No back-up.
Are you the leader of tis group?
Nothing if not vampires...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Your lover.
Yes... My God...
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
No.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Does it?
No. Laudanum.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Sit still. It's not finished -
Claudia - don't -
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
And you never cried -
Not yet.
Yes...
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
What danger?
That's not so.
You really believe that?
Yes...
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
I want it!
But why do you want me?
Yes...
Sure...
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
But how do you know?
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
NO!!!
What are you saying?
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
That's all past, Lestat.
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
Yes.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
No...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
What about a radio?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
No.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Yes.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Can't what?
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
Will you try...for me, please?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
I'm fine.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
I'm okay.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Rio, baby!
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
What is up with that weirdo?
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
Good winds and bad winds!
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
I think not.
She has never mentioned her family.
Thea is an orphan.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't understand you.
Her family name?
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
The General threatened me.
I can't.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Yeah, very funny.
Our clothes are dry.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
It isn't me!
No.
Yes, George?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Where is she?
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
The Building and what?
Hiya, George!
All right.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Uh-huh.
Hee-haw!
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Came back three days ago.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
No.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Oh, George.
He's pretty young for that job.
Have a good time, son.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hello, Vi.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
George . . .
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
They're not my children.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Tuesday.
Do you like it?
Well, then, sit down.
Don't you like her?
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
But of course.
Someone pop your balloon?
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
That's awful.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Anyone got another set of sails?
The rope!  The rope!
Can you get us a line?
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Happy to do it.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
In here.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Every day?
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Hey, come on....
Sean's still out there.
You said something about a camera.
Me neither.
Too late, it's written.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
So there's one around here.
Why?
It's good with coffee.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
What'd I say?
Just one minute....
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Someone has to do something.
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Dad!  Dad!
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Great.
I will, I will.
That's a crock of shit.
What's that mean?
Just like this.
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
And second?
Figure they split?
No.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
You always go with Andy.
Yeah.
Would you take him?
Len, can I see you a minute?
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Want another one?
They're acting very strange suddenly.
I guess.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Get out of here!
Yes.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
I talked you into this?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
What's that?
How's your patient?
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
... He ought to put him in here.
It's a shark's tooth!
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
I don't understand.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Fine.  Have them do some.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Afraid I can't do that.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Get ready to go.
Brian, he's coming around!
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
He's missing.
Sure.  No problem.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
The one that goes underwater?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Now what's this do?
What, hon?
I am serious.
Hey.
Precisely.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Five hundred yards.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Sharks???
So was Dad.
Something wrong?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
I like it.  Really....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
I'd be afraid of losing....
It's beginning....
Whatever happens next.....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Stop what?
Adds flavor....
You check it....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
I won't....
What's going on?
I'm still five....
It's not nice to be evasive.
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I am.
Good.
You just got here....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
I always listen to my feelings....
No one does till they learn....
Nothing....
A big one....
No!
You'll be sorry.
Good.  I have two left....
I do....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
She's a tough lady....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
Put me down....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
What do you know about him?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
I've got to get to her....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Anything to do before I go home?
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
Oh no--
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Is it your vehicle?
I hope I'm not intruding?
"Welcome to Eureka."
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
O.K.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I already did. What's his problem?
It's a method for quitting smoking.
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Then give me that Zippo.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
Listen to me saying what?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
No .. You didn't know that ..
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
I'm going up to the institute.
Hey ..
Bits.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Once.
Maybe he's lying to you?
Bullshit.
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
My hands?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
No.
I don't know.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Of course I would ..
You should. It's wonderful.
No.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Have you known her long?
No I'm not.
I know about alcohol, John.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
A derelict.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
I know about the bachelor party.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
-- stop --
Listen to me, it's over.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Oh come on --
Oh, tell the story.
Well, take care.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
You think so?
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
And I am...
Sure.
You don't have to explain.
Right.  I'll come in.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
So this break... is a break-up.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Mmm.  Hmm.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Very much.
Why not?
Oh my God.
Uh, not today, but --
I understand your anxiety.
Great word.  Towel?
You.
Fine.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Rod, get on the camel.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Don't be silly.
You okay?
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
I'm scared.  What is it?
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
One way to find out.
What?
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Nothing.
We have to help him.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
I would completely support that.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Sure.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Really?  What do you do there?
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
A well-accepted theory.
Any weapons, radios?
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
I want to be an astronaut.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
I have never been on this island!
But you never came across just one.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
It doesn't matter what I think.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
John . . .
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Not without a shot of the nest.
I don't even know this woman.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
The velociraptors.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
What do you think they want?!
Where's Kelly?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Funded by whom?
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
What?
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
Damn!
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
How would we cut off the lysine?
'Bout thirty seconds.
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Six weeks?
Are you sure?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
What kind of park is it?
Dilophosaurus.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - barfs them up - -
I don't know.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Okay.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Like hell it is!
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
I get ah - -
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Hola, bienvenido
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
What are we looking for?
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Listen, ahh - -
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You have no idea.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
Machines hate you?
Kids get scared.
I know.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
John, John.
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
Thanks for the presents.
What?
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Yeah?
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Fuck you.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
So?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
So what do we do?
Not yet.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In what sense?
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
In a manner of speaking.
An empty tomb?
What an extraordinary request!
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
I'll commit that to memory.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You're just doing your job.
You're detestable.
Sit down, Kafka.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
In a small way.
I do.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
I know.
Why would you suppose so?
One of you must be mistaken.
Yes.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
I -- I found your jailer.
No -- not this time.
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
Can I ask -- how you found me?
What makes you think so?
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
... A piece of paper ...
It usually is.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
No!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
) They are now.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
You think people hate you.
Here please.
Like for you to look for the man.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
My name's John Klute.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Mm.
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
Most of them.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
No, I said what did you think.
Not much point to this, is there?
When?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
-- Then you don't need me.
We did this before.
I don't like getting splashed.
Don't touch anything.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Trask wants to talk with you.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
Can you use these?
I better keep looking.
Well as a matter of --
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
It's in the report.
All right.
Has she talked with you since prison?
I think she's trying that.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
I looked it up.
What else do you know?
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
He's in his room, playing.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
Not particularly.
The prospect of losing my child.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Greatest...
Show...
On earth.
Soon.  Very soon.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
In a minute...
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Uh huh?
Oh...
I love you...
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Where will my toys be?
Overruled.
Yes, your honor.
Then I have concluded my questions.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Objection!
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Yes.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
You've been living here, in the city?
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Such as?
I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Yes, what?
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
What?!?
I don't believe you.
Murray.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
I'm going to take it.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
No, but--
Look, Ted, all I--
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Three.  And add some basil.
No.  I don't think so.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Uh, huh...
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
A moment.
No cried?
I know.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
And you have horses? You love horses.
Here. We'll collect them.
Are you, General?
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
Soon.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
Yes.
We do not know.
No. This war is almost over.
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Ahh.
But, I have no experience.
No, Holiness.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
We cannot.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Too young?
I see that.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
Thank you.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Mr. Cyr!
I coulda shot you, you--
No crocodile has ever--
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
We both know what they'll do.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
What's going on?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
I <u>told</u> you.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Good.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Excuse me?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Night.
I heard something.
Alright, Jack!
Okay.
Well...
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Likewise.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Yes.
Was he swallowed?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
I thought I saw...
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
<u>That</u> was a bust.
Look.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Kevin told me you were upset.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
Liar?
Why not?
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Where?
That wasn't me.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
I think we may be, yes.
Yes sir.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
But if he knew we have so little time -
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
Sewing...
Did you ever work with her?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Yes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
All flayed...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Killed outright?
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Did he try to?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
When? How?
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
"Some"?
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Yes. Yes, I will.
Dark haired...
No.
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
: Only one or two loads.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
That's all, sir.
What did you see, Major?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Webb's at Edward?
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Fire!!!
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
And this?
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Be my guest.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Fuck your orders!
Shit...
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Can't we fix it?
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
It bit me!
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
Who cares?
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
What are you going to do to him?
Let's hope it holds.
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
Oh man, that's just great...
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
It's a Samoan pub.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
You get the guns?
Where're the others?
Yes?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
All right, Dad.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Furry muff, let's go.
OK, open the gate.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
Out the back.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
Right as rain.
I'11 meet you in the car.
A hundred grand.
I like your bar.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Seven hundred each.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
At what, exactly?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Six.
Twelve.
How the fuck should I know?
We need fertilizer, Winston.
So?
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Oh, come on, Amado--
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
I-I can do the job, sir.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
No, sir. Not at all.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Thank you, sir.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Yeah.
He swore by it.  What?
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You little pissant--
That's in Maverick County.
Do I seem jumpy?
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
They fought against the Indians?
But they were Indians themselves.
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Dad--
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Made some money, came back here--
Lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
You could take it--
You know who it was they dug up?
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
That's right.
Why would you want to do that?
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Aqui! [Here!]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
'57, 1 believe--
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
We have a murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
The Perdido thing?
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Steve?
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Well, you hire illegals--
I was too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
I don't mean Fernando.
I never said that.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
That was the night he disappeared?
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
So I've heard--
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
They've got my Amado.
Are you okay?
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Yeah.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
I came back 'cause you were here.
More, I hope.
Couple months before I was born--
Just doing my job.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Yeah. It's quiet--
I know that.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Who is he?
Why would I do that?
He's a priest?
Why did you wait so long?
And you don't ask questions?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
They won't tell you anything.
Some or it.
No.
I wasn't.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
We've never met.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
A Mister Quaid?
What's her problem?
And what does Jennifer think's real?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Sure.  Vivovich.
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
It's me betrayed him.
I don't know what else to do.
Will that do?  No?
Is that all?
And you're not?
No.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
A couple of weeks.
Yes.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Bob, it's me.
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
I'm here for the week.
Ok.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
Yeah, you don't remember?
I know, I kind of blend in here.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Where'd you grow up?
Yeah, look at that thing.
Around.
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
Hi, Bob.
Yes?
Yes?
Is this a bad time?
Is there anything I can do?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Why do you have to defend her?
What?
I got some hair stuff.
Bye.
I don't know.
Sure.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
Hmmm.
What happened?
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Must be a spare set.
I found the pentacle.
And how would you describe him?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
You heard voices, you know you did.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What?
What's the bible for?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
What did he say to you in French?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
We millionaires yet?
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
He's looking right at me.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
She's alright.
The blue.
He's fine.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
You're a caterer?
You're cold?
Gotta wait til the press conference.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
No one's forcing her.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Oh, great.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
What's up, Sidra.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Who's Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
That what you think?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
I know, right?
Quit.
What?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Quincy...
What's up?
Here I am.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Few days ago.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Kiss my ass.
Thanks.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Something was just missing.
We need to talk.
Hey.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
What mess?
What?
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Came by to check on you.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I don't know.
ooohhhhhh no.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
GET OUT.
I'm coming!
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
It's fine.
I don't have a boyfriend.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
yeah, good, ok.
Good bye.
Bye.
...yeah...
Let's make a deal.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
ok.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Can I tell you something?
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
please, what is it, please --
Yes.
Yes.
Diet Coke.
It doesn't matter.
It's upstairs.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
Son, please, now....
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
It's ok, boy.
I'm a rapper.
I was listening --
-- and I'm through playin' games.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Yes.
Yes I do.
Don't do this, Don.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
She loves you.
Yeah.
I've seen it before.
There's no asshole like you.
It's ok.
Graduation?
Twelve.
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
You got us a room so quick?
-- let's talk more about your background --
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
And that's what you've heard?
What am I doing?
Hollywood, mainly.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
Right.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I'm really sorry.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
Calm down.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
I went out last night.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
I got in trouble at school.
Fuck no.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
As fast as I can.
Will that help?
I'll answer anything.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Maybe...I don't...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
...I don't know...
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
What's MOW?
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
I'm trying to help, Linda --
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
mmmhmm.
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Water.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
-- the fuck are you talking about?
Should be one-thirty.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Sure.
I didn't know the answer --
I don't know.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Yes.
It's ok.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
And you were not hurt?
No, stay back!  Stay back!
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
He is your brother!
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Shut up, knave!
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Yes, and he has a choice!
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
So what has changed?
You can't do it.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
No, not Louis!
Come on...
He is right, d'Artagnan.
Who does?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
Raoul --
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
I know.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
And you never knew why?
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
Your Majesty has had many women --
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
At least help Raoul.
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Yes, yes, go on.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
I... we are humble people...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Sire, I --
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Don't worry -
Fine...
Gotta come from somewhere...
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Did he harm the girl?
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Up north.
No.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
What happened with the tape?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.
What else is new?
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Hop in.
Did you have sex with her?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Christ!
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Twenty minutes max.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
When do they go to press?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
What's it narrow down to?
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
You wanna watch this or what?!
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
He went to the men's room.
In eight days.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
You'll come by?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
I'm very scared.
Please, no.
Not me.
You'll let me go now?
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Goodbye.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
What about the dog?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
You haven't smoked in two years.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
You going back down to Florida after?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Are you George Sherman?
My name's Will Graham. I...
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
No.
...yes.
Stuart is fine.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
I haven't decided yet.
Tank you veddy much.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
George, I hate sitcoms.
Those are my terms.
Hi George!
But wasn't it funny?
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Andy!
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I can shtop whenever I want...
You don't know the real me.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Okay.  You're probably right.
What?!?
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Are you sure?
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
He said he's coming back!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
It's my name.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
Oh, God.
If you get caught using that --
Right...
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
What are you doing?
Really?
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
What do you know?
... Yes.
It's an honor.
Far from it.
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
Because... I didn't think I would?
What -- what lesson?
How?
That's why we're here.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Good.
Who?
From you.
Why?
... shit.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
She told me...
... right as rain.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
I believe I can bring him back.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Not yet.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Neo, this has to be done!
What are you talking about?
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Tank, it's me.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
That means it's good.
Well the guy over there said...
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Can't we come with you?
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
No, she isn't.
Did you see them run!
I understand.
Don't be smart.
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
We'll be here.
Whatever.
Yes, you did.
Ok.
Teresa.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Here.
A paper on that one too?
You're intolerable today.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
The girls like it loud.
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
 Shut up.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
I know...I know.
Friends of yours Michael.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
No.
And you could care less --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
It's for the party, Dad --
That you've been to Susan?
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
You mean this, sir?
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Am I not obligated to?
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Then why did you bring it up?
Yes.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
Me, too.
As close as a deal could be.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
What?!
What do you mean?
How nice for you both.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Thanks, Quince.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
I from dat nex' place.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
She knows you real self?
No.  Nothing.
Love.
But she loves you?
What do you mean 'free'?
No.
I'm sorry.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Be sorry for nothing.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I don't know.
To bed.
Yes.  I'm tired.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
I don't know who you are.
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
I love you in an evening gown.
We know all that we need to know --
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
Yes, that's why I said it.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
-- Yes?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
I won't.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
It is a deal?
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
I guess so.
Yes, Bill.
No.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Why didn't you stop me?
I don't know.
I wouldn't put it that way.
Goodnight.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
This universe?
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Yes?
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Say again?
Does she know where she's going?
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Thank you.
'...Yes --'
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Then don't.
I think you know --
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Time.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Yeah, I give a shit.
Sure.
Yes, I believe I do.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Does Drew tell you everything?
...Then don't.
I know it's none of my business --
That's all?
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
We've met.
I don't know.
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I'm having a helluva time.
That's why it's okay.
Oh, yes --
You and 'Honey'?
I could be her.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
Did I say something wrong?
Why not?
No --
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
What's it like?
Hi, Leonard.
When was I in here?
Just two. So far.							  *
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
That's right I did, didn't I?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Who did this to you?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't say anything else.
Yes.
Yes.
Deals?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Somebody's come. Already.
Calls himself Dodd.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
What?
Are you Teddy?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
I enjoy it.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
You know it?
I don't remember.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Why are you following me?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
Sammy didn't have a wife.
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
What's your twenty?
Turn around.
I was the kids' godfather.
It's a rip and a hit.
You do.
Okay.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Later!  Do you dance?
Exactly.
Zero risk.
Hola, viejo.
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
We're makin' moves on each other.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
To recruit you.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
How will it stand up?
Sonny...?
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
...and thanks for the flowers.
Not French registry?
"Future" of...?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
Alonzo...
They lied.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You sure are a pretty lady.
Sure you're all right?
For money for what?
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
You like it? Take a look.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Don't say nothing about you either.
Yeah.
And what?
Who?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
What?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Yessir, I can see that.
Instant V-goddam-D.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Getchmis...?
...He had a bald skull and...
We go through the wall?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Stupid.
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
...She was on the plane.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
That doesn't seem so bad.
He wasn't even in the car?
How long?
What do you mean?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
What?  You gotta be joking.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Cut his fucking throat.
I want to cut his throat.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
You know where it is?
I know where it is.
Oh shit.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Mr. Yesil.
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
What?
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Manny...
Please.
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
No, there's...
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
No.
It didn't bite me.
Toss the flare down!
What-
The scent won't last...
Your arm, you can't...
Ah...
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Anything you can tell me might help.
Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
How long...?
--my number one fan.
Will I be able to walk?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
The phones are working?
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I can live with "great."
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
Well, I hope you like it.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
Annie, what's the matter?
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
A toast?
I think you're right.
No, I haven't.
Be my guest.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
I'm almost done.
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Oh, I like that tone.
What thing?
You think he might be missing?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
Did they win?
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Great.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
All done, chief..
What else?
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
It's that time.  Go.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
You didn't do that badly.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
So do I.  Sort of.
I'd like a little more conviction..
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Just like old times.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Twice.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
I'm fine..
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Krieger.
Talking's good, walking's better.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Who is they, who is they?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Is this the only way?
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Yeah.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I'll get you close.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
Let's move!
We'll see.
We're not outta here yet.
Jack.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
Can you lose him?
I remember..
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
Keep counting Claire.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Jack...that's spying.
Itís not working.
I always check the batteries.
Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
His brother.
And go to confession.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Ti amo.
Again?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
He did?
What'd you do to your hair?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
Alright. I didn't see you here.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
I'm going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
Maybe I should come back another time.
I'm making you a steak.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
He knew my husband who died.
Why what?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid.
Just Johnny.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
That light.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
Oh no I didn't!
What?
I can't do that!
I can't!
I'll come to the wedding.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
For what?
It's the best thing there is.
That's right.
Yeah.
I was.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
No?
She was too young for him.
I shouldn't.
I don't understand.
This is a good suit.
How about a month from today?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Sure.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Everything's different.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Did you see it?
You gotta date?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I came right from the airport.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Where is she?
It's late.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Johnny...
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
It's nothing!
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
Yes.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Good night.
What? What?
Is who down there?
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
The Britons.
I am your king!
You don't vote for kings.
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Oh, please!
You said it again!
No, no ... not "is"!
Come on you pansy!
Had enough?
Course I have.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Bedevere, my Liege.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand |      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              HECTOR |      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              ROBIN |      Look out. | |  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.

Quite.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Shut up!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Shut up!
Come on, patsy.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Course it's a good idea.
To find the Holy Grail.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
I think I could pull through, sir.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
What - the curtains?
I'm ... your son ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
No, I'm not.
Please ... we are doctors.
Look.  I'm warning you.
I didn't.
No, no, no.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
I'm getting dressed.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
Get out.  Out!
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Of course.
I'm flattered you think so.
Quite.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
Occasionally.
It's nothing.
I'm not married.
I wouldn't know.
Maybe, once.
Why?
Why do you think I keep her here?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
She trusts you, John.
See what?
I'm glad of it.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
What does he know about the Highlands?
I heard something.
Yes, ma'am.
I do not accept.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
The question is, do we need her?
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
To know when he'll be king.
You can't know that for sure.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Whom?
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
No.  I shall be out walking.
I have no idea.
Your Majesty --
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Hey, kid.
We are talking...
Funny.
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
I'm in the middle of it...
Sure.
No way.
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
What?
And beat it at it's own game.
What are you going to do?
You didn't hear me?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
You've got the schematics, check.
There never is.
Never been on a snowboard.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
I'm going home.
The Cowboy??
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
I'll speak to someone.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
One.
You're an understandin' fella.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Well, I ...
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Are you okay?
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
What?
Diane?
I don't know who I am.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We'll take our check.
Maybe it's not me.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Not a coke or anything?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Yes.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
I work here, remember ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
Knock yourself out.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
What ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Checking........
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I was.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Then what do you want ?
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
You're paying the bills.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Thank you.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
I just need to sit and think for a second.
Which one, this door is locked !
We just having our first date when you showed up.
What ?
I'm fine.
We made it !
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Don't mention it.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
What boy likes you?
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Was it a nice funeral?
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Totally groovy huh?
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
Oh.  Ohhh?
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Come on in!
He likes you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Then I have come to the right place.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
I want juice!
I won't.
Yeah, RIGHT.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Oh my gosh, here it is!
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
I'd never do that.
What if you don't wanna be found?
And I thought I was weird.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Oh no?!?!?!
Leave me alone!!
Big deal.
Good. I mean...
Nick?
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
Ten bucks.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
They're great.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
I was commenting on your hair.
I'll be here.
You couldn't?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
I bet your mom sang to you.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
I know, look at his little hands.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Yes.
What Hurts Vada?
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Deceased.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
It's no big deal.
Okay.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Okay, sure.
Here?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Then who's it for?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Why?
Sorry.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
What??
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh come on.
Are you sure about all this?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Thank you. Bye.
Thirty five dollars.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Hi.
Uh huh, why?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I will I promise.
I'm allergic to it.
They're just fun to read.
What are you saving for?
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Uh huh.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
So?
You're right, let's knock it down.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
He likes her better than me.
No, I'm hiding out.
It is not.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
... weeks.
Kindred spirits.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
And you believe that.
Impressive.
What do you suggest?
And what will he do?
Oh, you're more than okay.
You need a few dollars.
Can you watch the road?
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
He said that, too.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Ju...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
... unless he has a hump.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I know Ben.
It doesn't say th...
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
I got the point.
I never eat when I'm serene.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Never can tell.
Like I said, dazzling.
Have you.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Me either.
Well.
Yes.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
... maybe it's congratulations.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
MICHAEL!!
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Well, that just happened that time.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Bye, Bye.
They can come to the concert in the park.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Third party?
What does he want?
What!
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Okay.
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
She's in Paris.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
I think we can do that. Come in.
Suits me.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
No.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
No, I don't.
Hi.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go.
I have to go. He sighs.
I'm not sure.
What?
I'm sorry but I have to go.
How much?
Hundreds of times.
Do you study at all?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hello.
What?
Where are you from?
Who?
You think I should take lessons?
I see.
That's what Tim said.
What...
Yeah.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I can appreciate that.
I see.
What?
It's video.
How 'bout Manson?
Aside from the obvious?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Okay, let's cut it.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
I do, too.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
That's my opinion.
Thanks.
Yeah, sure.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Perfecto!
Slate it.
They're mesmerising.
But you'll never be whole again.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Really?
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Okay.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Where was that?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
I been sendin' her money.
Like where?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Thanks.
Oh yeah? That's good.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
What is it?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
No.
That's the way he is.
Just for the day?
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
How about it?
Don't call them that.
I don't want to hurt you.
We'll be all right.
I keep thinking about him.
Yeah!
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Like what?
What 'you signifyin'?
Yeah, see you in hell.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Who're you?
Wouldn't have known you.
What's on your mind?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
That's right.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
She don't look no worse to me.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Thank you.
I doubt it.
I guess not.
Don't look like there's a right way.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
It's for your own good.
'Musta knocked her up.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Hi.
I'm fine.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Dixie McCoy
No, but it traced me.
What about McCoy?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
What are you talking about?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I find out now.
Yeah.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
All things possible in Babylon.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Jah guides us.
What?
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
We got problems topside.
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
How's the ice?
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
What the fuck... are you serious?
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
Case...
Give me five minutes.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, it's lame.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Transitioned?
Have you been to any parties?
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Are you in special ed?
Yeah, you gonna be there?
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Yes, desperately.
Better than I...
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
I know.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Thank you.
You remember that story?
I don't have to say that.
To put us back together again when we fall.
Oh--yikes!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
But now you don't have to--
I finally found my story.
What?
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Who are you guys?
Yeah. Definitely.
Lock.
Barrel.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I can't help it.
I know.
Just what?
Good.  I'm hungry.
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
Just out for a while.
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Where's Jesse?
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
What the hell are you talking about?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
I'm sorry...
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
I don't know.  Where are we going?
What's this?
What do you mean?
I'll get over it.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
I'm not hungry.
No.  I'm okay.
Okay...thanks.
He's full of shit.
Deal.  Thanks.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Nancy...
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call me Nancy.
Didn't get much sleep.
With Hypnocyl?
Doesn't matter.
For what?
I can do that.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
And what are they?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
What?
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Uh, fourteen.
This is stupid.
I'm an actress.
Films mainly.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
No.
I forgot my bag.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Yes, you did.
Step aside.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
You've got to go.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
You and every person in this country.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
How do you think I'm doing?
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Hello.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
And what would you say...
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Yes.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Miracles do happen.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
... get fired.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Yes -- sort of...
Well, yes.  Groovy.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Blimey.  What's that?
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Topol.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Definitely no comment.
That's not fair.
Is it someone we know?
So not over her, in fact.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
So -- any messages?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
No, 'fraid not.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
No -- you're right.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Fabulous.
So?
What book?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
No, Miss Ratched...
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Thank you, ma'am...
Sorry, ma'am.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
No way.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Hearts.
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
M-M-M-Mack?
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Yeah...
Ca-na-da...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Yeah!
Huh?
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Through the ass.
Me, too...
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
What for?
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I just started!
No!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Yeah, Mac?
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
What is it?
Hold it!
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Good. Good.
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
'Kay, Mac!
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
I'm the next one.
Because I quit breathing.
You're on!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
You's better believe it, brother!
No...
What?
On what?
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
Now you talkin'.
Is he one of the loonies?
I thought so.
Oh, yeah...
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
No, she wasn't my sister.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
--separate, in the evening..."
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Exactly.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
What's mezzaluna?
But Faith--
Hi there...
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Who's this?
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Yes.
He's safe.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Right now?
Oh.  That's nice.
What are you doing here?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Are you asking me out?
GET OUT!!
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Yes.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Beautiful place...
Tonight?
Well, not exactly...
You would?  Really?
What?
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I know.  You're right.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
I think he's having an affair.
What about your job?
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Maybe.
You're coming with me?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
Are you sure?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
'Course he does.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
No one's perfect, Kate.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
When you could've found one in America.
Uh huh.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
He missed me.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She's not here.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Thanks.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
Why should he forget it?
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Why Edie, I—
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
Which side are you with?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
You training to be a nun or something?
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
Oh she's a beauty.
In a saloon?
How do you like it?
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
What I did to Joey.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
Get away from me.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Mind your own business, Father.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to—
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
What about it?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
I'm just resting my feet.
Yeah, really!
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured—  They got it made. Eat all they want— fly around like crazy— sleep side by side— and raise gobs of squabs.
Hey look-
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
What do you mean?
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Go on, beat it!
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Keep Charley out of this.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Then..then what's that music?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure...
Be careful!--They'll see you.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Ahh, there is yet time.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
Then why do you shake so?
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
I'm so frightened.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Yes, it is.
What?!
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
I know a Glenn.
He'd call every once in a while.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Who are you?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
He knows where she lives?
I'm a tourist.
Sure looks that way.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
I don't know.
And who watches your back?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
Shit.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
They're in 7D.
You're gonna use a ram?
Call and tell you.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Excuse me, Adele?
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
There a problem, Foley?
Another C.
I don't smoke.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
We're leaving.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
I wasn't asking permission.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Uh-huh.
Who was it answered the phone?
And your gun.
How do we do that?
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I can go to the bar.
So do you.
To warn her about Chino.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Okay.  How many going out?
When?
You know who they are?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
I'm not leaving Midge.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Islamic.
Meaning time came, I left.
Like what?
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Can I do what?
What-- when?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
How you know that?
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You a lawyer?
Something better.  Open it.
He's still married though, huh?
What're you doing at Glades?
Huh.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
I told you, he isn't here.
Like a fag.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Well, I need that...
Where the fuck is Foley?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
That's me, Sir.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Yes Sir.
Hale-what?
You guys are new?
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Power dive!
Good shooting, Rafe!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
What facts are those?
Fuck you.
Come on!
Six P-40's.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Respect.
You too, 'Mam.
You too, Lieutenant.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
God help them.
Crank her!
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
I can't. It's all too much.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Just what you underlined.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Would you?
Thanks.
Save it.
What am I going to do with you?
Let's go down to the basement.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
How'd you know about that?
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
Right here. Now sit down.
What?
Of course.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I've got to go now.
Charlie? Was I dead?
What about Janet?
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Test?
Touchy, touchy!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
What are you shooting for?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
I hate chickens.
What?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
That would be impossible.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Please don't shout.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
How do you feel?
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
I'm just happy to see you.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Rosalie Testa!
What was?
You're a sweet man, Richard.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
What's that?
I	know what a burrito is.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Well... uh... thanks...
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
It sucked.
You alright?
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Yeah...
In a word, Bob...
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
A reaction to AZT...
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Close the law book.
Maybe you should think about it.
Honesty is always best.
About my blood work?
He's upset, he's sorry.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
I have AIDS.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Not bad.
Thank you.
Do you... pray?
What happens?
You're ready, don't worry.
What impressed you about him?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Really?
Answer the question, please.
Objection.
Yes.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
It satisfied me.
I might.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
In a word, yes.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
What kind of people?
Second.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Charles...
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Entered our minds.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
I can't....I can't....
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
It's starting....
Possibly.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
What?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
79 kilos.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Company's not here, is it?
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
I'm born-again.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Not staying in here another....
Looks clear.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
Just the same, I want one.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
Right now, if you like.
No.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
The evidence was very meager --
Yo!
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
None at all.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Huh?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
We're here to stay.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I think you're making a mistake.
What?
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
My name is Taylor.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
What about it?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Which one?
Yes.
Taylor, please --
We can't.
Like you, I find it difficult.
Says he can't walk.
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Fuck you bitch.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Shaddup bitch.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Youse so fucked up man.
What?
Barnes comes from Hell.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
I got one...
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Yeah.
Dawn...
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I don't know.
Thank you.
Just drunk enough.
Possibly, Miss.
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
No, please.
I see.
What did you say his name was?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
He got in here how?
Sure... but somebody always does..
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Couldn't be.
Absolutely sure.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
They'll look for you.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
Yes.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
What will they do to you?
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
This way.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Leave that one lay.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
A couple of hours.
Would that make me a heel?
That COULD BE TOLD.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Lay off, can't you?
How would you know, Brandon?
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
That's not enough.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Such as?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
Pretty big chance, huh?
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
I'm interested in who handled it.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Aye.  You have a point there.
Why should I mind?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
Years, why?
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
How about your new friend?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
It's kind of you to see me.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Yes.
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
I'm not sure I can face it.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
How nice.
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
I know.  I'm sorry.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
Let me see.
Mmm...
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Yes, finally.
Hello.
What about the Cromwells?
That's good.
No, thanks Dad.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Voila!
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
I won't.  Goodnight.
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
You first!
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
I'm not FBI anymore.
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Sir?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Got it...
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
This Zen master surfer.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
They took a left at the next light!
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Warm them up.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Who's our back-up on this?
This gets better by the minute.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
We're not going.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
There's something else, Major...
Hawkins?
I think it's Hawkins.
He knows our defenses.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
No.
You what?
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
What's that?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
The price just went up to ten.
Sit... and spin.
Not exactly.
It pays.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For an hour.
What?
Why?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
Oooh, thank god.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Just a romantic, that's you.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
"Occupational hazard".
What?
All right, two thousand.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
You're forgiven.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Good.
Please.
Shall we mingle?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
Where are you taking me!?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
You just did.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Thank you.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
But, Edward...
Let him answer.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Yeah.  I just got it.
Rent.  You're late.
You're a guest here?
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
But I always eat like this.
But what if they serve soup?
Me?
Miss Vivian.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
It's very expensive.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Then I'm here till I die?
You're a silly girl.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
As you wish.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Gently.
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
And a good thing too.
-- where?
But you don't know where he is.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Yeah. It's really good.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Because I can stop now if you want.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Who won? How did it end?
And our assets?
There we cannot help you.
Light him.
He's already dead.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Thank you.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Then why are you smiling?
Tell me.
No one of consequence.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
Where?  What?
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
But what if the play was a hit?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
No kidding?
Yes.  We would!
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Got dag pa dig.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Of Siegfried...
Vat?
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
How early?
Or arrived with her.
She isn't still here, is she?
If she paid you well?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Must've needed it.
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
Of course not. Please.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Like what?
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
What do you know about it?
I hate tears. 
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
Maybe we can handle it together. 
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Yes.
An hour! Or less!
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Who's he?
Of course we will.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
Watch your tenses.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
I could stand something regular.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
Sam!
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
Sam! No!
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I haven't even been married once yet!
I'll lick the stamps.
Don't miss your plane.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
I have?
Uncommon, too.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Haven't any.
I didn't think so.
Shut up!
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Who are you? What is your name?
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
Yes!
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I don't agree with you.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Well, I do say it.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
The body of Joan Gale!
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
And they never proved anything against him.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Get out of here.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
How's every little thing?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Old Howard Winton's cub?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
What does that prove?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
Heaven knows. A lot.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
Day or night?
I could go out of town.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Well, I got to see her.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Nobody.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
You were pretty bad, huh?
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
But Rose...
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
What are you going to do, Rose?
What was your mother like?
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Yeah, he's still up there.
Well, it's not very plain.
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
What did you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
Okay.
At least.
They're discussing it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Here comes Daddy.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
No, son, she is dead.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
I think we both know her.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
She will succeed.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Well. What kinda job is it?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
I don't believe it.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Gonorrhea?
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
... okay... you made your point.
What and?  That's what I got.
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Again.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
No you can't.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
Yeah.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Follow me.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
There'll be other chances.
Where have you been?
You can't be serious.
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
It's our job.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Shit.  You're right.
No you're not.
Oh yeah?
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Sounds good.
Who is that... ?
Beholden to none.
Keep 'em busy.
It's one of a kind.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I can't kill my own father.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
How are we doing?
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
We got separated.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Your Royal Highness.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
I know, father.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
There is no conflict.
Never-r-r!
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
I told you, my car broke down.
Rocky!
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I've got something to say.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
It's alright Janet.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
A decision had to be made.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Like I'm outside in the rain
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...Fine.
I think it's closed.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
I don't think you're a bum.
Morning after?
I think he might be worried.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
Could ya take off that hat.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Don't want weak legs.
I gotta go out for a while.
...What?
Don't say that.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Paul.
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
You's the novelty, Champ!
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
...It's very American.
Fouls.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Does that bum have to say that?
Why?
No dollar.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Bob.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Do I have to pay juice?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Sparrin'?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
Stuff it, man!
What?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
'Night, Marie.
I said, how ya feelin'?
Yeah, Kayo.
...No.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Freak luck for sure.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
See what?
Would you keep goin'?
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Looks, huh?
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Absolutely...
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Whatta these guys want?
...People talk to me more.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Shoulda guessed.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
A tweeting bird?
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I'll bet.
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Doom.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
So what do you want me to do?
Aren't you the lucky one...
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
No, I don't.
Yeah, that's better.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Me.
Safe?
I rest my case.
Yeah?
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Why, what is Tybalt?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Young Romeo is it?
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Ay me!
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Right.
I thought all for the best.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
And I don't believe you...
And who are you?
And then...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
You lose them!
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Is that right?
Nobody's saying they don't.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Ready when you are...
There's a problem...
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
I think not.  After you...
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
I don't have it with me...
A post office box.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Not for long.
Is that right?
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
What a surprise...
I don't think so.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Like Larry or Swede.
So is the woman.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
You were smoking?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You don't have to do this.
Right now?
So I do it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Do you have a good answer?
Gone.  Destroyed.
Why didn't you kill him?
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Seven thousand...
Never heard of it.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
That's right.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
It's NOT too late!
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Shut up, Jesse.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
You mean that guy was an agent?
Has he?
Hi.
He's not, he's...
How the hell did he find it?
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
Yeah.
This just might be our ticket!
Maybe I should come along.
Dwayne.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Anything...specific?
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
Sure.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Take it or leave it.
Sort of.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well I'm here now.
What?
I didn't say that.  You did.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Right behind you.
What?
You're never getting that much.
Hi.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Anything in it?
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I'm not getting an answer.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No, I just assumed...
How much is that?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
I said get on your feet!
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
Oh yes, she's very nice.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
No.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
This won't take long.
I am a tourist.
How you doin'?
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
You pull a muscle or something?
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Excuse me?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
She's walking back towards the door.
It's your turn!
She never even looked at you.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
No.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
It's worth it to me.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
This money is evidence.
Fine with me.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
How do I know I can trust you?
No.  But I'll help you.
Now you know.
It's my responsibility.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
I know, Master, but...
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
This is pathetic.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I know a shortcut.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Stooly.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
Yee-aww.
Good God, ya'll!
Oh yes.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Where'd you get it?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
No...what?
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Don't play bullshit games with me.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Nobody touches me.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Thank you.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
What?
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
-- The luau for Maggie.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
You'll answer my questions?
Yes.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Agreed.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Of course.
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
Me?
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
She's the boss.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Why?
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Lighten up, what?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No.  It's my life.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
They're going to love you.
I love you.
Nope.
Walter, I'd love to --
What is it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
-- it was a betrayal.
So what happened?
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
What was what?
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Thank you.  I love you.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Any time.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Mom, we already...
Grace heard it.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
What's she talking about?
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
What is it?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
You think so?
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Window.
Stressed.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
What?
Whose show was this on?
Go to sleep.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Not now, Jonah --
It's only ten o'clock.
Okay.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Victoria? She's okay.
It might be in the kitchen.
This conversation is finished.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
You look good yourself.
You did?
You could have called me --
I read the same article...
That's none of their affair.
I don't make policy.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
No.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Like what?
Will you be still?
You mean Delaware?
I thought maybe you forgot...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
That's it?
No.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
I was talking to my wife.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Colette ...
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Why not?
You get off on abuse or something?
How?
Trust me. We're safe.
You really need to lighten up.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Please open the door, Danny.
You always been this stubborn?
Ass first into the world.
I just can't. Okay?
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Guess it's our turn.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
Yes, Jimmy.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
I don't trust anybody.
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Crank or glass?
Make me an offer.
Anything for a dear friend.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Hey, I don't play that.
Big Bill.
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
It's not my place.
When?
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
My name is Tom.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
What?!
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
And you've got wiener breath.
What do you mean?
That is so unfair.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Maybe he isn't showing.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Cap'n...?
I guess.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Keep trying.
White-walls?
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
Senator's son?
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Pass.
You think the rest of us were?
I heard.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
A machine gun.
You don't count.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Simpson.
That's not what we're here for.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Vecchio.
Yeah.
Bits and pieces.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
Just what I want to do.
I know.
You're welcome, John.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Yeah, how so?
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Why's that?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Yes, sir.
And Sarge?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Lingerie.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
What about you, Captain?
Twenty-four-five.
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Understanding the following rights...
Good for her.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You're sure?
I hope you understand.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Yeah.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
What's a scam?
I'm gonna call her.
Lloyd.
I admit nothing.
Meaning?
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
I'm fine.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Hi.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, not monumentally.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Pardon me?
Would you hold this for me?
No.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Twisted?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Job?  Being a great date.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Okay, bye, I will.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah.
You're shaking.
Your letter came yesterday.
How can I look at you and say this?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Oh shit.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Man, you're bringing me down!
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
No.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Hey.
I don't know.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Klaus Tauber.
War.
It's a beautiful city.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
True.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I don't know.  Soon.
Look -
I just told you.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
Yeah, okay.
Nice things cost money.
Yeah.
Things are great, things are great.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Wine?
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Yes.
The war could end.
Oskar -
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
Stop it...
That's smart.
What? I can't hear you...
I'm losing you.
Who is this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
You have a right to be angry.
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Why don't you ask them?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Not one bit.
She dumped me.
Yeah.
The forbidden subject.
I'll get my jacket.
I think it's out of your control.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
You’re not going to get away with this.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
What guy?
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Yeah, right.
Just in case...
What if your life depended on it?
You're pretty when you're angry.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
Don't do this.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
I counted four.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
What's your favorite scary movie?
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Melinda McGraw?
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Good bye Ben.
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Absolutely.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Catch him, or kill him.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
And who is that?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
What?
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Do you want us to come with you?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
What the hell are you doing?
Need to get in that building?
Good twist.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Yeah.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
W-what do you want?
Yes.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Who the fuck is this?
No one's saying you did.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Oh...
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
What?
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Are you alone in the house?
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
To apologize.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Guess.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What do you think I said?
Don't hang up on me.
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
No...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I can't think.
NOOOO....
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
What?
Your call.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
What kind of lead?
...yeah...
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Not yet.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
What about the cellular phone bill?
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
You want to go live?
What's the delay?
I owe you shit.
Has his story changed?
So who are you?
That's the original part.
Right here.
Uh-huh.
...out at the airport...
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Twice.
You got it.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
The why'd the police let him go?
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
What happened?
No way.
Do they know who did it?
They think it's school-related?
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
I bet he's pissed.
And you believe it?
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Oh, god...
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Thank you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
Announcing what?
So what?  This victim...
I heard.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Where was the girl?
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Hello.
Her pretty head.
NO!
You'll see.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
You know that's not true.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Shut up!
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
I realize that.
For now.
No one yet.
Guessing at this point is useless.
Good.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
Tonight.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
And, if it's a threat.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
Satisfy our curiosity?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
That is.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Then, he must write about these murders.
You do your job...
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
When do we get to question him?
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
What did you say?
Don't do this... please...
I can't do this now... please.
What?
Oh... um, William.
It surprises me.  It really does.
I'm sorry, I only...
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Why don't you finish the job?
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
Ain't yours yet.
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Oh...
Scar?
Look?
Never heard of him...
We won't be here...Come on!
Not no more.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
I got your boy killed.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
It isn't fair...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Someone from the village.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Yes.
Writer, is he?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
See you in jail.
Ten pounds.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Yes, I saw it.
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
That's me.
Partners!
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Nobody knew!
it will be all right, madam.
She is always Aphrodite.
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Fifty pounds? What for?
To my weekly confession.
Tomorrow
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
No, it will turn out well.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Do you think?
"Is the day so young?"
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
You have opened the playhouses?
If they find you here they will kill you.
Can you love a player?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
There is.
Oh
Mr. Henslowe?
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
You never spoke so well of him.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
I was the more deceived.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Orsino…good name
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
But why me?
The Queen has consented?
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
A theatre poet?
You are on my ground.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
He couldn't get his car started.
You call them if you want.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Security.
There was a break-in.
I beg your pardon?
But there's no --
I don't know.
What does it look like?
I see.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes.
Well, yes.
For the flat.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
So what's wrong with that?
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Yes.
Did what?
I'm just looking.
OK.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Forget it.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
You're frightened.
Everything.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
The perfect couple, I should say.
No.
What?
You were going to say something.
Yeah.
Burglary?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
No.
What?
I should hope so.
You and me?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
That one, last week.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
I'd be delighted.
It's a breeze.
No.
Did he sound upset?
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
A certain weakness.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Chicken salad, Devra!
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Maybe... why do you ask?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
What are you talking about?
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
What?
What kind of treatment?
Yes.
Right now, I just don't care.
Nobody can hear it.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
I guess so.
Hello.
Yeah.
Hungry?
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
Yeah.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Why?
Don't make conversation with me.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Yeah.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
No, I'm sure.
It's hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Do you? You still see him?
And what?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
What?
Hey, I don't tell.
I don't want to... I swear...
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
He never stopped.
Nothing.
Look who's talking.
Why?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
Wanda...
Wash her.
-- please, please forgive me...
Hey, stop by the shop.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
Where?
George, I don't --
Keep moving --
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
I do, Jill.
I'm very tired, George.
Oh, Christ.
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
But Mr. Norman said --
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Well, yeah.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Thank you.
You're right.
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
Okay.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
Oh, hey...
Isn't that bad for it?
Layered?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Now wait a minute...
What can I say!
I know.
Lester, it just happened.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
What?
I'll call you back.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Steve?
Aren't you going to have one?
Who is that?
So what's your point?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Nothing.
Jackie --
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
What did you do?
-- no.
-- oh I don't know --
Let's do that.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
That's fine --
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
No.
No.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
Come here for a minute, first.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Dad?
What do you mean?
Yes, Dad.
No.
Try to think what it was.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Danny, come on over here.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
I won't, Mom.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
No.
Do I have to?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well how can I repay you?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Fine.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Grady... oh.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Good.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
What time is it?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
I think he did it to himself.
Yes.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Give me the bat.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Oh...
Oh!
Oh, I'll say.
Hi.
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
How do you do?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
What?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Yeah.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Sure.
Yeah... sure.
A tracer. You'll like it.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
What the hell does that matter?
You want to know what I think?
Marty, do you see your suspect?
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
There! You see!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
We won't!
Perhaps.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
Were you tempted?
SING!
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
With love.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Yes, Betty?
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Not in years.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
What a shame!
Enough jabber.
Whatever.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Wet behind the ears.
Amateurs 2
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Five a.m.?
I... I brought you something.
She won't?  Why not?
What?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Honey.
Your name?
Enough joking.
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
Would you like that?
Can do.
A what?
My what?
Useless distractions.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Get a stenographer.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
I've been worried about you.
How?
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Oh-huh.
Really.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Which one!
Which one?
Willy -- hit the lights.
Neither did you!
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
We're losing it.
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
That was exciting!
It's better than ice cream.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
A Benedictine.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
She said they were from her old convent.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Excuse me?
You will stay at her side?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What?
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Hmm?  See them?
Well... that might be... helpful.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Chosen me?
I shall, gladly.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
I did not ask you to, did I?
True enough.
Stay back.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
In test... what?
Baltus Van Tassel.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
There is no such thing as magic.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
What would you have me believe?
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
The Horseman.  Yes.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Doctor, he is awake.
May I see my mother?
She did not do it... please listen...
No.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
You got any money?
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
That boy wants me to.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
You have any biscuits for sale?
French-fried potaters.
Give me the big'uns.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
He does make some funny noises.
Please Doyle, don't.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't tell me what to do.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I thought I told you to keep out!
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I aim to kill you with it.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
All right then.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Yeah, I did.
Two people.
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Yeah.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
Yeah.
All right then.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
He ain't no count.
I don't reckon I know.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
A little ol' boy.
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Did Karl go to bed?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I love you, too, Mama.
Yeah.
I ain't got no boy.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
My history.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Okay.
All right then.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
Not really to speak of.
So, you're really going to stay here?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
Can I help you, sir?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Before they were married?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
Huh?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You what?
Yeah, like what?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
It's all yours, baby.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Sure thing. See you later.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
What difference does it make?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Huh?
I think I'll take them. 
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
Not a one.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Say hi to Paul.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
In Manhattan?
The what?
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Eight-thirty?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Are you going to be all right?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
You don't really want to know.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
Why don't you go to the police?
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
What time did you get to bed last night?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
No way.
The end.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Is it yours?
That's it. In a nutshell.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Yes, please.
Carl Heine's type.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Twelve.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
Won't take two.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
Yes, he was.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
It is.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
The same.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
I already said that, b...
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Carl never lied.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Such as?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
Funny?  In what way?
Thank you ever so.
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.

A what?
I'll say.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
They got the bull-fiddle.
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
You tore it again!
Fight it.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
And I'm not even pretty.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
You - you -
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
That's right.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
What?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Good night, honey.
What did you say?
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I have a very low resistance.
I'm fine.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I may spill something.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
I'm just going to get some ice.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Yes.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- and you got to be girls.
Me too.  Bye now.
You're not sure?
Most of the time I slap it.
Why?
Goodbye?
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
We won't breathe a word.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Yes, Joe.
It's not the backs that worry me.
You got to be under twenty-five -
William Morris!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
No - funerals.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
About what?
What's in Florida?
You're entitled.
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Up, up, up.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
Tonight?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
If it's at all possible -
They repealed Prohibition?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
That makes me feel just awful.
What happened?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Thank you.
Mineral baths - now really!
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
I know.  Every time!
Booze.
Coffee?
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Go where?
Big joke!
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Why wouldn't I?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
What for?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Still--
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
And you do now?
Oh, hello.
Yeah?
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Not for a dog.
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
I slept with your sister.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
I don’t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
It’s cute.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Oh, no.
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Show me.
Not dollars. Pounds.
It’s my job.
Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
Make out with you for free.
You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Hi.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
You knew?
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Ahoy!
Just drunk enough.
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
That's right--
That's where we come from first?
What he talk 'bout?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
Yes, Miss Johnson...
She was dirty and wet...
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
NO! N-O, NO!
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Come here, son...
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
September 4 -- how far away is that?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Sausage and hambones!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Yes mam...
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Listen, Mama...
Did you find your father?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
He can't get up, Mama!
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
I'll walk...
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
They probly thought you was crazy.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
I wanta get some things.
Little chilly.
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
Is there something I can do to help you?
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
There are more important matters right now...
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Doggy.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
About what?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
YOU DO?!
Whoops.
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Mph rm.
Aw, ma!!
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Uhh... Bacon.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Kyle, check it out.
You bastards!!
It isn't fair!
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
What the hell is going on?!
Oh God... What have I done...
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey, come here, guy.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
What's the matter, Wendy?
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
He's shutting off the air!!!
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Oh yeah...
You're Warren Wayne.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
I'm sure I will.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Uh...
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
You better start making sense!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Good help is hard to find...
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Just don't move around too much.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Seen one like it before?
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Wait.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Sure.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
How does the distress signal look?
I'll do my best.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
That is one of my priorities.
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Talk to him...Jesus...
What are you going to do about it?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
What do you want with old man Faz?
La da da dalala...
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
It's mine.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I couldn't care less.
He says that to all his wives.
I am underground.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Who's there?
Junior who?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
How Mr. Kastle?
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
Look who's talking!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
They suspended me.
Whips...orange whips.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
We'll get into that later.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Plan B is your dad.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
...lane six. Yes.
You got any broken bones?
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Suck my dick!
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
I can't see...
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Two and a half days?
What was that?
Forty yards.
Pull it, damn it!
What team?
Press?  No, I haven't.
Storm?  What storm?
They didn't tell me anything.
What's wrong with oxygen?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I don't know.  That's the point.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Pull it.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
What the hell is going on here?
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
How do you mean, strange?
He understands me fine.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What -- are you threatening me?
Yeah.  Drowning.
Yeah, why?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Beth --
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
I have to reset the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You don't trust me?
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
He what?
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
But why is he doing it?
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
It's a soporific.
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
Where are you?
You think I'd really drink that?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
No, he isn't.
No, he can't.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Get away from the door, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Don't you know?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Hear what?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For whoever's in that thing.
In time for what?
Just in time for what?
We can refuse to talk.
What?
I'm not being defensive.
No, why don't --
Whatever I can do to help.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
What are you still doing here?
What is it, Harry?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
You didn't say that about the food?
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
I'm trying to keep balance with --
I'm trying.  There.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
"We are friends".
Does this mean what I think it means?
No, they didn't say --
Like what?
This is like nursery school.
The creature?
Not that I know of.  Why?
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Who's going to pay me then?
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
You mean I generate an energy field?
He's bluffing...
He can't find Organa Major.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Send one squad up.
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
You don't believe in the Force?
What are you saying?
Why?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
I got Games & Theory.
I'm getting better.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Only when I give you an order.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
So who's got time to get married ?
Funny...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Your turn...
I have good reflexes.
Excuse me...!
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Carl can wait.
How do I know if this is love ?
Good luck at the academy.
You two have so much in common.
Who cares ?
I'll go for that.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
Alright, I love you.
We've gotta go get her !
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
How come we never got together ?
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
All bands.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
I won't quit !
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Sir, yes, sir !
Here in Buenos Aires.
Courage, I guess.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Uh, no.
Move out.
Not a problem.
Kill the bitch.
What's going on, Diz ?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
The Creator has not answered.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Departure angle.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
It's taken control of the computer...!
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
This served the purpose.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Viewer ahead, sir.
Thrusters at station keeping...
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
I am seeking answers, Captain.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
We're ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Sure plan to.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
Yes.
Yes...
I understand...
Goodbye.
I love your script.
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
<u>Yes</u>...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
I thought you had Play Practice.
Paperclip?
You have to sign for it.
Oh, God...
Read the card.
Then I'll come back, then.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Going home.
I'd love to.
Gosh, you look nice.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
You'd do the newspaper right here.
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
If I go to jail...?
Morning, darling.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Yes, that's right.
What are they offering?
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
No.  Don't tell me that.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
This horse is booked.
She wasn't in the...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
You mind...?
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Mr. Barrenger.
Of course he...
The Mayor's outside.
Thank you.
I think he's moved...
Then what is the...?
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Why?
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Marty...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
I can't tell.
Well.
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
No.  No, but we're planning to.
You should.
The writer.
Sure.
You bet he did.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
I can only write on a manual.
I grew up on your mov...
I don't drink.
Why?
The girl was in the car.
So be it.
I...
No.
I don't know.
I left that for you.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Is that one hell of a kid?
There's no witnesses...
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
Sherry, Sherry...
And we're glad to have you here...
George, that is so kind of you.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I hate when you say that.
Excellent point.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
It happens.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Why does Rachel scream?
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I bet.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
Great.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Oh, yeh.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
That doesn't bother me.
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
Not use my words, please!
But Rache...
You owe me a quarter.
There's worse things.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
I have lava.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Is that like Luigi's?
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Before you.
Oh.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Remarried.  There is no move.
You think I didn't get that?
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Not to me.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
I live or I die.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I did it for her.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Not personally.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Yes?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
You're a cross-dresser.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Don't be too sure.
Give 'em my number.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
Double.
No, there isn't.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
It was a veal stock, I thi...
For what?
Rache, it may take time.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
That's not us.
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Does Jackie know this?
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
It was God's will.
My grandchild-baby.
He's dead.
For rape and murder.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Nothing, I guess…
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
How was the class?
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Tired of this shit...
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
OK!
Well, now you have.
Thanks.
Say, Ni...
Again!!
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Oh, I don't remember that...
Hunh.
Yeah, sure.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Thanks.
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
So where'd you get in?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
He did?
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
Who's got matches?
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
Like where--in your dreams?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
How much do they have?
Excellent...excellent!
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
If I don't get power up we are!
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
What?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
That's government property, Major.
What is your name, young lady?
What did you say, sir?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Do you recognize my voice?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
No, sir.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
I know that, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
What the hell is Plan-R?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
War?
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Primary arming switch.
Some kind of signaling.
Forget it.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Like hell it does.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Roger.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
I don't anymore.
Knock yourself out.
Yeah.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
Was it okay?
What did you guys think?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Yes.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
And your mom.
Where are you-hoo?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, no.
Buff...
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Guess not.
Come on.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Buff is funny. God.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
I could.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Okay.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is.
Military marching bands.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
We were?
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Funny shit, man.
Thank you.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
I don't know.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer Chaudry!
Look, look, just get off my property.
I hate that.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
So you can give me more shit?
One!
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
I would've stopped it.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Nothing.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Mm-hm.
No, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Yeah, really.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Well, what about this?
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Hey!
Look at you!
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Hey.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Alright!
You done?
If...
That's because I am.
Oh, my god!
Yeah?
I think I gotta go.
It's none of my business?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Hey, Tim.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Sorry, Kansas...
You just became a statistic!
Wayne Gretzky.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Y'think?
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Jack...
Mmm-hmmm...
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
He Ikea'd us.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Kansas?
Maybe we can make a deal.
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Bank branch!
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
More proof God's a guy...
I didn't mean to --
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
I'll take it.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Nothing for Ladd?
Are you hungry?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Who's who?
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
What were you -- a child actress?
Nice job.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
It must be my new shampoo.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Whose?
No.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
It's a good script, isn't it?
I knew there was something wrong with them.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Get out!
Yeah?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Uh-huh.
And you'll play Salome?
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I don't know.
December twenty-first.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
You can stay here.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Okay.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I've lost my car.
What's wrong with It?
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
What's that?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Yes, Norma.
Why do you say that?
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
No, they don't.
Good.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Frankly, no.
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
This is the staircase of the palace.
It's what we were warned about.
Eliminate her.
Who didn't?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
What do you feel about me?
What's that?
No.
Well...I guess one is all right.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Just like that?
Do you want to come to Argo City?
I did.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
And you think you're in love.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
I don't want your help.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Nice to meet you.
Can I quote you?
Oh, no thanks.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Oh, sure.
How do you know?
It's going to be a tree, I think.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
This is all your clothes?
You're not...an orphan are you?
She's a beast.
Must've been a defective puck.
You sure?
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
He's nice.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
For what?
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Zaltar!
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
What? What did you tell me?
Brad Wilson.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
The kid needs a man to show him --
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
I didn't --
Who?
Oh...I came close once.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Kent!
We get together sometimes.
Say!
Yeah.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
One.  And a half.
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
That what they call you?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
What will it do?
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
You just did, with that great dinner.
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Diet soda?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Turn on the light.
53!
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Let's get you inside . . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Lois, I really don't see why --
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
No possibility for parole?
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
North.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
Sentimental idiot.
We must combine our strength.
I really don't think . . .
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
Don't worry, I've got you.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Go on . . .
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Daddy . . . ?
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
An angle?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
This wasn't in the plan.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
First, I have fun.
What do you fear?
Destiny.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
It was hot, yes.
No.
Unbelievable.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
There was a recipe on the back  --
Tea?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
I'm wearing it.
But so is Vond-El
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
What's your name, boy?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
He will be odd, different.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
You think they're strange?
It's not bad.
Thirty-five.
Uh-huh.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Pink.
Sure.
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Otis...
It is for me.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
Maybe I should get help.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
They'll soon be over.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
She didn't.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Alison.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Billy, that's too early.
It's natural.
Sure.
And they loved Bear.
Berry-picking.
Did they give him special care?
What other people?
Yes.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
It's interesting.
I feel like a princess.
The people in the town?
Okay.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I won't lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
Is there shrimp on it?
Well, let's see what we get.
In what way?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
How will he do that?
Nothing.
I don't know.
There's talk of that.
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
I doubt that it matters any more.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Hurry back.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Susan!...
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
Are you finished?
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Don't go wild, Sidney.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
What sort of thing?
But what?
That's no way to talk...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Why not you?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Why did you call me?
Those lying motherfuckers!
No one must follow your work.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Why?
Chill out, dickwad.
Smile?
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
She intends to change the future somehow.
Dyson.
Remember what I said, you can't...
What?
I'm sorry, John.
And what it that?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
So do you.
Why him?
Can you get us in there, past security?
No.  There is another chip.
Yes.
I don't know.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess it's possible.
Five minutes.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Not yet.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Yes.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I don't buy that.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
I was warned.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
This is absolute nonsense!
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Me? Never.  Never.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Helmuth.
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
How could I forget?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Yeah?
One of my people?
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
His private life?
Yes.
Sure.
Right. Claims assessor.
Absolutely not.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Right.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
What?
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
You like it?  It's my first.
Okay.  Talk some more.
What's that?
What about it?
That's the way it was told to me.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
It's better that way.
Kyle...
Cover...our footsteps...
Yes.
Why?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Projections were far too optimistic.
The stock will turn.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
Did you?  Kudos.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Please, don't do that...
What are you babbling about, psycho?
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
He's turning blue!
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
A game?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
How do you know that's the way?
Never mind.
You first.
You pull me up.
My hero.  Let's go.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Come here...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Nicholas...
What are you talking about... ?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
I didn't say anything.
Who the fuck cares?
Scams, con games.  How many?
What do we do?
What are you doing?
Stop talking to them!
No...
Underwear?
They'll be wanting it back.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
No.
Fun?
This isn't an escort service?
I said I would...
I'm going to call.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
You're part of it...
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Yes, very lucky.
Of course, Nick...
Yes.
A game?
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Have we met?
Is there a room key?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Fine.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
It was a misunderstanding.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Sam...  Thank you.
What?
Well, I... uh...
Sure.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
-- how much is this car worth?
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I got more scared.
I don't know.
How'd I know it was for you?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
It's okay... we're all here...
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Oh!  You scared me.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Why would we --
No one will come any nearer than that.
Fifteen dollars.
That's why we're here.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
I know.
You're okay.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
Maybe you did it yourself.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
I think so.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
Why?
Like you.
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.
I'm a gracious host.
Where do we go?
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
I wouldn't talk.
Been to the Boat Show.
No reason.
It was better than a telegram.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
Not me, man.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Again?
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Been busy, have you.
It's been a while.
That's not what I heard.
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
Not ashamed.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Footloose and fancy free.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
I'll bloody well ask him.
Hey?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
You ever been to London?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
How do you know?
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Eh?
He had urgent business in the north.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
Walked.
I doubt it.
I don't want you here, Terry.
You know I don't live with him.
Tell me.
Yes. Thank you.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Boy.
Geez, Mr Crane.
He didn't say that.
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
Well? How'd she do?
Did she make mistakes?
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
No. I--tell me--
But it's...
Just coffee.
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Honey?
Mm.
Honey...
It was Big Dave's.
So... who... who actually--
So--
So, who should I--
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Whuddya mean?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Could you come with me please?
Not an owner.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
It better be good.
Great.
Calm down.  I found it!
Hurry up!
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
What doors?
Where the hell are you?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
What's left of it.
Where's the head?
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
Oh shit.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
He's right.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Big as a house.
Like this.
You're color blind.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Get back!  Now!
Quiet.
But at what a price.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
It's reptilian.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
You have time to talk?
And John?
You were going to be married.
Would you mind showing it to me?
I don't know.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
It's coming.  Run.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
<i>A month.</i>
That's right.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
All prop cars accounted for?
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Amnesia.
A window onto the human condition?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Let me demonstrate some examples.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
You think she'd go through with it?
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
So when are you leaving?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Who?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
I've been thinking--
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
I bet you did.
Well, I made it through another night.
You're welcome, Truman.
--How do you know about that?
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Yup.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Looking for him for what?
And one little boy.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
I'm not sure. A virus --
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Your guess?
No you didn't.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
No.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I don't know.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
I don't know, Mulder.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
For the purpose of what?
Come on!
Just like that --
General McAddie's.
Thank you.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
Driver.
How?
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Shush.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
No.
Yes mother.
Why did we stop?
Give a kiss to Edward.
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
I realize that...
Do you think that's funny?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Peter, okay?
What difference does it make...?
Okay, okay...
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Yep.  Eloped.
I need you to find something in the basement...
I think that's the whole point.
What's wrong?
Sometime yesterday morning.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Dr. Kent.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I don't have to.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Sit down.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Dr. Winkel.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
It's just what he used to say.
I thought you wanted...
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Me.
I don't know.
He told you, didn't he?
Oh...
How did you know I would be here?
I saw him today.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
His.
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
They're Harry's.
It wasn't important.
It's true then?
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
Yes, of course.
Yes.
When did you see him last?
I can't say that I have.
Getting around, Martins.
I see.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
No, I don't know...
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
No, a major, were you really?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Of course, of course, of course.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
You can help her.
I told the police.
You can get somebody else...
You've got plenty of contacts.
What did he say?
How do you do.
I understand...
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
What else?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Not necessarily.
Oh.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Yes?
Help you out?
Traveler.
Good morning.
We moved rooms because of him.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
Nice work.
What!
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Fuck off.
Incredible.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
Uh-huh.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
They don't have extermination camps.
Who the fuck are you?
Then I won't bring you....
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I have a job.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
I just read it....
You want it to be an event.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
What do you care?
Why?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
What assholes.
You shouldn't.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
I don't know. Is that right?
Why?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Of course they're Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Listen to me....
No.
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
The arguments, anyway.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
How did you...?
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
That's meat.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Steve...
They're not my people....
A Jewish prayer.
The mother.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
You said they didn't have night guards.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What are you trying to say?
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
Fund-raising??
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
The documents are forged.
In a lake.
Have you known him long?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
What are you doing here?
You know what I'm talking about.
I won't, I swear.
Don't.
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Lira?
Six seconds.
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
He's training.
Noireuter.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Fine!
No...
Enzo...
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
... You married?
Everything about what?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
Well that's very nice of you.
Who?
... Okay.  I'll try.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
Uh... Yes, of course!
I did?
I'm still here.
You'll understand.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
You go back, I'll walk.
I saw how it has to be.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Then, goodbye.
Let him sleep.
What's up?
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
C'mon follow me.
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
I forgive you.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Mazel Tov!
Oh yeah. Take a look.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
I drink.
I don't know.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Up at the museum.
No. I'm serious about this.
You found the leopard!
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
No. I'm quite sure.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
I know -- Teresa -—
Will you please come with me?
When will they be back?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
No!
Leon hung himself...
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Leon could still have hung himself.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Good.
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
You wouldn’t understand.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
What about your friendly cop?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
...On holiday?
What?
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
What kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
How are you, Jane?
Good.
Your secretary, huh!
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Does it matter?
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
I’ll be alone.
How are you, Rhian?
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
Should I be?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Shut up!
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
No...
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
What about his girlfriend?
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
It’s a good guess...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
So... pretend it's not a game.
Do you think I could have some water?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
What... what do you mean?
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Not yet!
But... why... what's the point?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Yes...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Am I... am I dead?
What about you?
But where are you going to be?
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
In a village called Domremy.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not long ago...
Buying her?
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
You think?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
But... her army's so small now...
You did well...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
Go on to the next question.
20,000 gold crowns.
For what?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
God.
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Jeanne, look behind you.
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
What do you mean, they won't come?
Oh no?  How about this one?
In His name??
Really?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
No...
Yes, my lord.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Who wants me to stop?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Wladek, please.
Dead.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
What?
Thanks.
Tough luck.
Who's recruiting?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Do they?
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
Toilets?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
I was listening, Kitten.
If you need help...
Sorry, I don't remember.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Watch his hand
The Alps.
I'll be back.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
Yes, I thought that.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
What are they?
Tomorrow.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
All of it.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
We'll be waitin'.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Forget it.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
You mean you blew it.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
The name is Lonnegan.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Where you goin'?
Sixty-five.
Yeh, sleepin'.
What the hell for?
He'd like to kill me.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
He cheats.
Yeh, he knows that.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
You're a lucky man, all right.
You got a system, Carver?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
Let me talk to him.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
I'll make parole.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
Never heard of the place.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
He was?
Is that what it means?
Just a minute...
Nothing.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Give it to me.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Macaulay.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
What would your mother say to that?
If you think it'll be all right.
A new invention?
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Only in bad weather.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Not a thing.
What'd he think it was to you?
I'm asking you.
I'll have to try to remember.
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Goodbye.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
I guess all the suspects are here.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Want to take a poke at him?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Go ahead!
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
What'll I do if something comes up?
No word at all?
Hello, Mimi.
Yes...
They'll want more than your word for that.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
I didn't knock Julia off.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Much better, thanks.
Take it easy.
We need ice.
At breakfast.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Someone get a doctor.
Want a drink?
Well, didn't you?
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
You talk as if I were Asta.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
Looks like a hold-up!
It was his body that was buried there.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Huh?
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Mimi...
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Yes.
I don't know.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Yes.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
You just go when I say go.
So we wait.
Ready when you are.
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
What about the gold?
Maybe we should split it up now.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
You said he was a deserter.
We're at war.
No.
We thought--
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
There might be something in there.
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
What are they doing here?
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Stay low.
Just stay down.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
So where do we start?
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We'll find our way.
Wes is dead!
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Yeah.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
I don't know!
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
We go this way.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
How the hell should I know?
What?
Really?
He's going to slow down.
Now you need me.
It doesn't mean anything.
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Oh, no.
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
We have to do something.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Yeah, we're down.
He lived through that?
I'm not wasting my water on him.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
What happened?
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
Eat your dinner.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Don't be so sure.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
I don't want to lose you.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
AH UGH.
They don't know.
No one can see us now we're alone.
We're leaving.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
I want you for my roommate.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
But you can't...you.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
All the insides are gone!
No!....
I'm only trying to help you.
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Where are they?
Go ahead.
Aren't you on suspension?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Where...?
Hey, look--
Your partner?
Be right back.
Me, too.
You got it.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
I don't know.
No excuses, just do it!
Easy, guys.  
We work fast enough for you?
Helluva fuck factor.
Who is he?
Taylor's dead.
Alex-
Stay here.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Shit. We're fucked.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Don't talk.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
I thought I told you--
Yes, sir.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
I know.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
And it had diamonds in the back.
And diamonds in the front.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
About tonsils.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
No.
Constantinople?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
Um-hum ...
Just a second.
I've got to see you.
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
I would like to.
No--proud. Very proud!
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Gaston Monescu.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Seven and nine!
What?
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
Yes.
I know that niche.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Oh!
As you like. 
Right!
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
And so will M'sieu Giron.
How do you like my dress?
Good night.
I know all your tricks.
Please! 
Yes, Gaston?
Divine ...
Yes--uh--
I know!
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
The pumps --
Thank you, Rose.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
So do I.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
I was tired.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
Not the better half.
What do I tell your mother?
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
No, but we're making excellent time.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
I know what ice fishing is!
You're welcome. Rose.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Is he your boyfriend?
She had beautiful hands.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Just move with me. Don't think.
A mistake?
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
He couldn't have.
I'm so cold.
I can't feel my body.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
That's enough.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Excuse me.
Charmed, I'm sure.
How'd you ever get away with it?
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Baloney!
I don't understand.
Montana?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
We'll be expecting you.
Not at all.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
Want to take it back?
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
I could stand some more--
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Brett is the name.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Very--your mother?
Okay.
I'll be there--Good-by.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
What do you know about them?
You can live that down, can't you?
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
What's the matter?
I thought you were a smart guy.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Shortie, look!
No, sir?
Change?
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Partners, ain't we?
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Swell!
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
I should say not.
She did?
Sure.
How?
Send that.
June? That's my wife's name.
Sure.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
Well, did you find me?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
I was never stiffer in my life.
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Do what--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
I'll never love anybody else.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Somebody's got to do it--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
About twelve hundred.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Not a chance--I'm through. 
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Thank you.
Sure, Sis.
Then why did you run away?
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Come and get him.
Good.  That's real good.
No...
Excuse me?
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Here it come: one-two-
Say when.
Better.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
But who was the Devil?
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
What?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Sorry...
Colorado's closer
Easy now... That mare's in season.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
You'd die for fun?
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
How would you know?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Fine.  Better.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
You're on.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Wyatt...
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
What about the gold?
I'm sorry.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Do you?
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Who knows? Fog, night...
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
I hope so.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
What do you mean?
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
If not?
I didn't say when I want to die -
Only what I read in the newspapers.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Fueled and waiting.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Thank you sir! Thank you!
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
We got the same thing.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Junior spends time with his child.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
What is it, noontime?
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Babe Brother.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Now how far would further out be?
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
Go back to sleep.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
What happened to your hand?
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Well, I would appreciate that.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You should go back and rest.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Whadda ya think?
No, I haven't seen him.
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Let's let Molly open one.
Rocky!  The ramp!
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Excuse me.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Where?
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Yeah, right.
But why would Andy want me?
Woody!  The rocket!
Not today!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Look!  Janie!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
Nothing.
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Last present!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Speed up!
Slink!  Hang on!
There's no mirror.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She'll have to learn.
Go away.
You're not so old yourself!
Finn -
I've got a present for you...
In my pocket.
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
Storms?
We're too young.
Victoria -
I can't find Manolo.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Arnie, thank God.
Why are you talking like that?
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Just watching you.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
You can't make me.
Yes.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Have you done your homework, honey?
Who do you work for?
She ain't in on it.
I don't know.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
Yeah!
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
When will you do it?
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Not this time.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
We agree.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
What is it you want me to do?
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Just tell me where she is.
You won't say anything to my parents?
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Yes, I hope so as well.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
Did you bring the cards?
Shut up.
And don't make any noise.
Because it's illegal.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Certainly not.
Are you clean?
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Unless you get caught.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
No.
Aye.
Right.
Nightmare.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Roald Dahl.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
When are you going to visit him?
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
Fuck you.
It was just an idea.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Your usual table, sir?
Stick it on my tab.
In that case --
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Yeah.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
No joy yet.
Six weeks.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
My pain?
Rescued at last.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Plotting our new course.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
I don't have a clue.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Are we leaving, Captain?
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Who is it he reminds you of?
What do you mean?
Damn.  Let's go.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
I did not.
He did have pointed ears.
Is what possible?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
"c."... "k."
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
The emergency channel, open.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
Not possible. You were never alone.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
Am I? We'll see.
The ship needs its Captain.


Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Senior exec.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
I'm certainly not.
Hello, Alan.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
Yes, okay, exactement!
The Pentagon?
You wouldn't dare.
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
I... have come to communicate with my User.
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
It's too far!
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Recognizers!
Little more juice's all it needs...
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
We have to.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Why is everything...like this?
As long as it gets us out of here
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
I'm shocked.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
You're kidding.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
It can't be.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
Here they come.
Sorry.
I wasn't cheating!
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Yes sir.
I'd like that.
Me too.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
What'd you do, honey?
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
Yes.
What did you need?
No.  Doris.
Yup.										*
Yes.
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
Absolutely.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Go ahead.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
I'm married!
We're going to Paris?
Find out who this Renquist it.
His wife.
Wait a minute -
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Knock wood.
This is great, we got cable.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Now hang up.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Sure. Why not?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
At the movies?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
My pimp.
Uh-huh.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
You will?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Thank you.
I just gotta get somethin'.
What?
What?
What?
How come?
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
So you do eat pussy!
Can you live with it?
He don't got no right to live.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You got it.
You goin' out?
Good for you.
Tell me.
Where?
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Want an animal cracker?
What department?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
I guess so. Follow me.
No.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
She seems very nice.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
I give up. Who are you?
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
What about him?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Sure was.
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
- Because it's good!
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know where we can find him?
No.
Uh, what?
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
You're still a little... disoriented.
I need to go now.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
Underground.
I have to go.
No, 1995 is the past.
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I've got one now.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
You're sure?
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
...I had a dream about...something like that.
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
You know -- your plan.
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Hey, man...
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
Then how come she knows what's going on?
You want something?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I said I was sorry.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
That's my morning's pay.
How much.
Time.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Just a car.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
It is morning.
Kirin?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
John . . .
John--
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You didn't hear something?
There's someone in the house.
You should be more careful.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
You're welcome, Grace.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
You know what I want.
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Yeah.
I can't.
Where?
How much money has he got?
What about us?
Stop it.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
We're going all the way.  Together.
No.
What about him?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
You heard me.  Count it out.
He was going to--
But I want to say with you,
Grace!
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
A lot that means.
John Stewart.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Would I what?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
No.
How do you put a price on murder?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
Is the job done?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
No.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Oz.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
Get away from me!
You expect me to believe that?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
What happened?
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Not as bad as it looks.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You know I won't be seeing you.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
An overheated car.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
And what does that make you?
You love her, but you hate her?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
How do you want it?
No!
It's the truth, Jake.
What?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
What the hell are you talking about?
Get away from me!
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Eh?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
You sure you can manage?
You should be more careful.
No trouble at all, really.
I just drove in this morning.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
How do you know he's still not here?
You could leave him.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
I'm sorry...
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
You didn't hear something?
I said come on!
Is Noel in?
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
He's asleep.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Yes. Is this David?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Yes.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
Seventy-five percent.
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
What was your idea Elijah?
Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
We've already begun.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
That's not what I witnessed David.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
What's he look like?
I want to sleep here tonight.
How much can you lift?
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Elijah was wrong.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
No.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Why?
No?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Oh.
Be careful with those, sonny.
Oh yeah.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
And?
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Is... is it... loaded?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Lookin' at?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
You missed him? You didn't...?
After a ways.
Lemmee see it.
You better get on back, Miss.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
You ain't like that no more.
Beats the hell out of me.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
How far kin you see?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Two more hogs got the fever.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Did I what?
Thought you was followin' me.
Plenty of times.
Just like that?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
And ?
There's more.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They'll never stop.
They ruined me tonight.
A glass of water would be nice.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
This whole thing was a shakedown.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
I don't want to know.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
You are a criminal.
Then who goes?
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Just do what I tell you.
What time is it?
This I had to see myself.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
You didn't know.
Who is he?
We want to meet him.
What'the fuck is that?
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
What?
You know damn well what I think.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I just want to hear your story.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
He loved her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
What lawyer?
The D.A. gave me immunity.
I don't.
I said I never heard of him.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
And no one will know the truth.
Yes.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
That's right.
Well, we...
Yes.
Yes!
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
No.
Through, through his book.
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
You may step down.
Yes.
Yes.
I . . ..
I...yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
You've just said you signed it.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Why is that?
...I made a reservation at...
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
... that's perfectly all right.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
Why is that?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes.  Price...
Missus...
And what are you?  A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work.
Stop pressuring me...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
No.
Right.
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
The broad has disappeared...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
Mrs...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Yeah.
As I've said we had some more...
How'm I doing so far?
Yes.
I married into it.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Almost a year.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
Why?
Your name. And --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
I want to know who you are.
Why?
Tomorrow morning.
Yes.
No.
They're none of them right.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Oh, yeah. There.
Madeleine died here.
Scottie --
Yes!
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
You like it, too.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Wander about.
What?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
No! No, thank you!
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Knowing I have to die...
The tall trees...
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
I know.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Let me go.
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
What car?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What's tomorrow?
More than you think.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Uh-huh!
What a pleasant hobby.
Normal.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Think?  Well, what do you think?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
I thought so!
Can we have it by tonight?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
I didn't hear you.
First of all...
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
You're pathetic.
You're not a team player.
You're a loser.
You fucking bastard!
You go home!
I'm not getting a ticket.
What?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Have you ever done this before?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Any time fat boy!
At the seven-eleven.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
Later.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
No. I think it's fucked.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I know...
I don't think so.
There's more.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Where is she?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Well, I didn't mean it.
I'm talking about prayer.
What is the question you asked me?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
What are you going to do?
I'm serious.
You need help.
Moore?
What?
They need leadership.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Goosed!
Goosed!
Yes.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Well it's bad timing.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
Okay.
Honey I don't have the time...
Not yet.
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
What!
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Now?
Are they fighting?
We're not canceling.
No.
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
I just want her to be happy.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
The wahoo moment?
What is it?
What?
A move?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
That's what I'm thinking.
I do.
A mutant species.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
That's our plan.
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, the children sleep with me.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
It's a present from my parents.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Who is she?
Thank you, Uncle.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Go away! Leave me alone.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Yes, sir.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
No.
How much do you want for him?
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
When you are, miss.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
No, I don't want to.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
Catch him and your record's clean.
What about them?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I'm still making adjustments...
What's wrong with Parker?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
I'm still working on it.
I've been in prison, remember?
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Nothing.
This isn't a game, Parker!
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Duck!
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
Why's that?
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.

They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
What'd ya think?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
...twelve years.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What are you talking about?
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
What did Albania ever do to us?
...I just hope...
Eight Days To Go 
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
Get on this, right now...
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
Gloria -- sell the House.  
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
Could we have you in here, please...7
Quite touching.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
...we own it?
Where is he?
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
I never won an Oscar.
Because.
I'm sure they do.
"Freedom."
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
Is he dead?
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
Watch me.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
They look stupid.
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
...for the beans, yes...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Get the hell out!
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
You speak for me, son.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
What'd you tell him?
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
He never told me...
...I can't even see it...
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
What? How do you know about my father?
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
How much?
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
How much is enough Gordon?
Gordon.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
I gather you're a decorator.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Upper West Side.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
Yeah, almost...
And what do you want?
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Get the hell out!
Any better and I'd be guilty.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
It's over you, Gordon.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
With Mark?
Yeah, yeah, OK
Hmm.
Thank you
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Vell.  Goodnight.
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Who's is all this?
China
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Mom.
You guys are being real assholes
I know he does.
Your husband?
Do you really think so?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Mm-hmm.
What does she look like?
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Have you been hurt?
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
At the party.
I don't know.
I have to go.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Is everything alright?
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
Thank you.
No.  No, I don't.
Please leave me alone.
She never mentioned her father.
I don't know.
You must have been very proud.
I should be going anyway.
This is...
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Jody, no...
M-E...
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Why?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Fine.
I know.
Nope.
Mmm.
Tomorrow.
Of him I think.
In the house.  I was scared.
What kind of whispering?
You're kidding.
Oh, no...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What's going on, Claire?
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
But then you've been so much better...
Claire, please...
I felt you...looking through me...
You told me that I was...
In the living room...
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Since when?
Who?
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
Get out of my way.
What?
Don't think so.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
But why would they do that...?
Every day  twice.
What are you talk---
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
You - are - a - murderer.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Like this...?
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I bring her flowers too.
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
But have I...?  Ever...?!
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
And whose houses do you design...?
You still feel that crazy...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Captain's orders.
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -

What about you coming down here...?
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Hello..
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Mm-hmmm...
What were you talking about...?
You bastard!
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
If you like that type.
You really love this guy...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Papers...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
The one on the left - definitely...
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
BRIAN...
I really don't know what to say
And how many people have you killed?
Where do you kill them...
No she didn't...
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
I don't know...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
Out - I may be some time
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
At home alone - where were you?
Get out...
I think you had better leave
Don't worry about it -
Oh...
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Were you always this sick?
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Well, Dad said...
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
I better go, Dad.
What is it now?
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
These are real, live women?
God, I love being dead.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Yeah?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
You have changed since second grade.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Of course we are.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
You mean they knew who I was?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
It's not up to me.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I didn't forget.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Interesting.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
To the best hiding place in the world.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
But you never do.
Amen to that.
That's hard to believe.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
I'll make you very proud.
Forget the store. Think big.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
What kind of ideas?
He was in a league of his own.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
I... You know... I...
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
She still work there?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
You could say that.
You have someplace to be?
Ray, you heard him...
What about witnesses?
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
I'm sorry?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Shit.
Police -- God -- get a life.
In back of the garage.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
Stick?
Why can't you come...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
You think that's wise?
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Are you mad at me?
Can't.  Got a passenger.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Shit. Here we go again.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
You need that real often?
Aha?
Is this leading somewhere?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
It's a repeating steam cannon!
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Relax.  We're almost there.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Of course not.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
What is this?  A whole new train?
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Really?
Your guests, ma'am?
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
Nicely said, sir.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
Dr. Loveless?
He had a pressing engagement.
That would be... the Mexican War?
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Yes!
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Who was this partner of his?
They're coming.
Yes...?
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Madmartigan.
I will!  But I need help!
Good.  How long will it take?
Why.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Farmer.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
I will.
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Willow!
Well what did she say?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
No.
That's all I ever wanted!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Me neither!
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
How are we going to get out there?
Maybe milking.
Not one this big.
Sorry. It's important.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
It's been a while.
Pretty much.
Okay, Mr. Book.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Just us.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
Don't try me, Johnny!
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Two days.
You tell him. When you're able.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Hochmut?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I know what he said.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
But... You may not be well enough.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
I didn't even know about it.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Say again?
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Not yet.
You didn't have to...
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
I know.
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
They don't have any shit.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Who are you?
This?
Hickory!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
How did you guess?
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Uh-huh.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
No --
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh! Oh!
Yes...!
Look -- it ticks!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
You're right -- I am a coward.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
I have so got brains.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Where's Kansas?
To Oz?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
It's too late!  There they....
Ah --
It did?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Somebody pulled my tail.
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Fine.  He's got a plan
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
You mean she bit you?
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
A heart --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
With this?
Elektra would control it all.
We can’t.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
She’s not a girl anymore.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
I took the initiative.
Who?
Renard.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
The worm on the hook again.
Indeed.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
You knew him well?
I’m sorry.
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
Really?
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
You can drop the act, it’s over.
I think you do.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
No!  Get me out!
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What?!
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Washington?
Wrong answers?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?

Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Where did he go?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
I don't think she's coming with us.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
I don't know their real names.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
What does this mean?  What does it --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Jon??  You mean he's --
Laurie!  Good to see you.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
"Anarchy" 99"?
He gets to be the hero.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
We hung out last night, remember?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
I'm from L.A.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
When can I see you again?
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Let me.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
That's would be me.
That one I'm real familiar with.
Alright, so I'll get more.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
Here we go again.
Is this what you're looking for?
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
For what purpose?
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Sure you are, sport.
I've seen a lot of rings.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Deal.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
You have the wrong house.
Victor Frankenstein.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Yes, sir?
I did, sir.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Yes, don't worry.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Goodbye, darling!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Is it worth taking a chance?
May I have it, please?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Break that old man's violin.
I beg your pardon?
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
How old are you, young man?
You must be Igor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Wockers with the knockers???
Fro-derick!
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What?
Must be the music room.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
It wasn't me.
I'm not trying to be funny.
... I'm glad that's...
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
What???
I'll bet it's a doozy.
It's the only way.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
Ja, ja.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
What do you think we should do?
Stop -- singing!!!
Not fooling around.
And I have mine.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Four
Yes.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Certainly, Sin
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
