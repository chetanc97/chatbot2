## Dialogue State Tracking Challenge Series

The Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) is an on-going series of research community challenge tasks. Each task released dialog data labeled with dialog state information, such as the user’s desired restaurant search query given all of the dialog history up to the current turn. The challenge is to create a “tracker” that can predict the dialog state for new dialogs. In each challenge, trackers are evaluated using held-out dialog data.
